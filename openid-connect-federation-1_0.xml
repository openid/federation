    <abstract>
      <t>
        A federation can be expressed as an agreement between parties that trust each other.
        In bilateral federations, direct trust can be established between
        two organizations belonging to the same federation.
        In a multilateral federation, bilateral agreements might not be practical,
        in which case, trust can be mediated by a third party.
        That is the model used in this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        An Entity in the federation must be able to trust that other Entities
        it interacts with belong to the same federation.
        It must also be able to trust that the information the other Entities
        publish about themselves has not been tampered with during transport
        and that it adheres to the federation's policies.
          </t>
      <t>
        This specification describes the basic components to build
        a multilateral federation and provides a guide on how to apply them when
        the underlying protocol used is OpenID Connect.

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This specification describes how two Entities that would like to
        interact can resolve trust between them, by means of a third trusted party
        called Trust Anchor.
        A Trust Anchor is an Entity whose main purpose is to issue statements
        about Entities.
        An identity federation can be realized using this specification using
        one or more levels of authorities.
        Examples of authorities are federation operators, organizations,
        departments within organizations, and individual sites.
        This specification does not mandate
        a specific way or restrict how a federation may be built. Instead, the
        specification provides the basic technical trust infrastructure building
        blocks needed to create a dynamic and distributed trust network, such as a
        federation.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that this specification only concerns itself with how Entities
        in a federation get to know about each other.
        Furthermore, note that an organization
        MAY be represented by more than one Entity in a federation.
        It is also true that an Entity can be part of more than one federation.
      </t>

        The basic component is the Entity Statement, which is a cryptographically
        signed <xref target="RFC7519">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>.
        A set of Entity Statements can form a path from a Leaf Entity to
        a Trust Anchor. Entity Configurations
        issued by Entities about themselves control the Trust Chain
        resolution process.
      </t>

      <t>
        The Entity Configuration of a Leaf Entity contains one or more
        references to its superiors, found in the
        <xref target="authority_hints">authority_hints</xref> parameter.
        These references can be used to download the Entity Configuration of each superior.
        One or more Entity Configurations can occur during the Federation Entity Discovery
        until the Trust Anchor is reached.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Trust Anchor and its Intermediates issue Entity Statements
        about their Subordinates. The sequence of Entity Configurations
        and Entity Statements that validate the relationship between
        a superior and a Subordinate, along a path towards the Trust Anchor,
        forms the proof that a Leaf Entity is part of
        the Federation configured by the Trust Anchor.
      </t>
      <t>
        The chain that links the statements to one another is verifiable with
        the signature of each statement, as described in <xref target="trust_chain"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        With a verified Trust Chain, the federation policy is finally applied
        and the metadata describing a Leaf Entity within the Federation is then
        derived.
        How this is done is described in <xref target="federation_policy"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification deals with trust operations;
        it doesn't cover or touch protocol operations
        outside those of metadata derivation and exchange.
        In OpenID Connect terms, these are protocol
        operations other than
        <xref target="OpenID.Discovery">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</xref>
        and
        <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client
          Registration 1.0
        </xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
        OpenID Connect is used in all of the examples in this
        specification, however this doesn't mean that this specification can only be used
        together with OpenID Connect. On the contrary, it can also be
        used to build federations based on any other protocols.

      <section title="Cryptographic Trust Mechanism" anchor="CryptographicTrustMechanism">
	<t>
	  The objects defined by this specification
	  that are used to establish cryptographic trust between participants
	  are secured as signed JWTs using public key cryptography.
	  In particular, the keys used for securing these objects are managed by
	  the Entities controlling those objects, with the public keys securing them
	  being distributed through those objects themselves.
	  This kind of trust mechanism has been utilized by
	  research and academic federations for over a decade.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Note that this cryptographic trust mechanim intentionally does not rely on
	  Web PKI / TLS certificates for signing keys.
	  Which TLS certificates are considered trusted can vary considerably between systems
	  depending upon which certificate authorities are considered trusted
	  and there are have been notable examples of ostensibly trusted certificates being compromised.
	  For those reasons, this specification explicitly eschews reliance on Web PKI
	  in favor of self-managed public keys, in this case,
	  keys represented as JSON Web Keys (JWKs) <xref target="RFC7517"/>.

        <t>
          An Entity Statement contains the information needed for the Entity
          that is the subject of the Entity Statement to participate in federation(s).
          An Entity Statement is always a signed JWT.
          The subject of the JWT is the Entity itself.
          The issuer of the JWT is the party that issued the Entity Statement.
          All Entities in a federation SHOULD be prepared to publish an Entity
          Statement about themselves (Entity Configuration).

          Entity Statement JWTs MUST be explicitly typed, by setting the

        <t>
          A Trust Chain begins with a Leaf Entity Configuration,
          and has zero or more Entity Statements
          issued by Intermediates about Subordinates,
          including the Entity Statement issued by the
          Trust Anchor about the top-most Intermediate
          (if there are Intermediates) or the Leaf Entity
          (if there are no Intermediates).
          The Trust Chain MAY end with the
          Entity Configuration of the Trust Anchor.
        </t>
        <t>
          If present, the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration
          at the end of the chain contains the configuration of the federation,
          such as the public keys of the Trust Anchor and other parameters
          considered within the trust evaluation.
          When this is the case, the Trust Chain
          consequentially contains the configuration of the federation
          at the time of the evaluation of the chain.
        </t>
        <t>
          A simple example: If we have an RP that belongs to Organization A
          that is a member of Federation F, the Trust Chain for such a setup

          <list style="numbers">

              an Entity Configuration about the RP published by the RP,

              an Entity Statement about the RP published by Organization A,

          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          A Trust Chain MUST always be possible to order such that:
          If we name the Entity Statements ES[0] (the Leaf Entity's
          Entity Configuration) to ES[i] (an Entity Statement issued
          by the Trust Anchor), i>0 then:

              The <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> Entity in one Entity Statement

            <t>
              There MUST always be a

              claim in
              ES[j] that can be used to verify the signature of ES[j-1],

          The signing key that MUST be used to verify ES[i] is distributed

	    It is RECOMMENDED that an Entity Configuration

	    <spanx style="verb">jwks_uri</spanx>, and

	    However, there may be circumstances in which is it desirable to use multiple
	    JWK Set representations, such as when an Entity is in multiple federations and the
	    federations have different policies about the JWK Set representation to be used.
	    When multiple JWK Set representations are used, the keys present in each
	    representation SHOULD be the same.  Even if they are not completely the
	    same at a given instant in time (which may be the case during key rollover operations),
	    implementations MUST make them consistent in a timely manner.

            <t hangText="request_authentication_methods_supported">
              <vspace/>
              OPTIONAL.
              A JSON Object defining the client authentications supported for each endpoint.
              The endpoint names are defined in the IANA
              "OAuth Authorization Server Metadata" registry
              <xref target="IANA.OAuth.Parameters"/>.
              Other endpoints and authentication methods are possible if made
              recognizable according
              to established standards and not in conflict with the operating
              principles of this specification.
              In OpenID Connect Core, no client authentication is performed at the authentication
              endpoint. Instead, the request itself is authenticated.
              The OP maps
              information in the request (like the redirect_uri) to information it has gained
              on the client through static or dynamic registration.
              If the mapping is successful, the request can be processed.
              If the RP uses Automatic Registration, as defined in <xref target="automatic"/>,
              the OP has no prior knowledge
              of the RP. Therefore, the OP must start by gathering
              information about the RP using the process outlined in
              <xref target="federation_configuration"/>. Once it has the RP's
              metadata, the OP can verify the request in the same way
              as if it had known the RP's metadata beforehand.
              To make the request verification more secure, we demand the use of
              a client authentication or verification method that proves that
              the RP is in possession of a key that appears in the RP's metadata.

              Client authentication methods that MAY be used include:

                  Note that if <spanx style="verb">private_key_jwt</spanx> is

                  <xref target="automatic"/>.
                  Here the verification is based on the fact that the request
                  object is signed with a key the RP controls.

          that is less restrictive than the one in effect, then it MUST be
          ignored.

            The <spanx style="verb">max_path_length</spanx> constraint specifies

            Entity Statements a Trust Chain can have between the Entity Statement
            that contains the constraint specification and the Leaf's Entity
            Statement.

          <t>
            A <spanx style="verb">max_path_length</spanx> constraint of zero
            indicates that no
            Intermediates MAY appear between this Entity and the
            Leaf Entity. Where it appears, the
            <spanx style="verb">max_path_length</spanx> constraint
            MUST have a value greater than or equal to zero.
          </t>
          <t>
            Not adding a max_path_length constraint just means that there are
            no additional constraints apart from those already in effect.

                The TA specifies a <spanx style="verb">max_path_length</spanx> that

              <t>
                TA specifies a <spanx style="verb">max_path_length</spanx> of 2,

            Domain name constraints are as specified in Section 4.2.1.10 of <xref target="RFC5280"/>.
            As stated there, a domain name constraint MUST be specified as a fully qualified domain name
            and MAY specify a host or a domain. Examples are
            "host.example.com" and ".example.com". When the domain name constraint begins
            with a period, it MAY be expanded with one or more labels.
            That is, the domain name constraint ".example.com" is satisfied by both
            host.example.com and my.host.example.com. However, the domain name constraint
            ".example.com" is not satisfied by "example.com". When the

          The Trust Marks used by this specification are signed JWTs.

        <t>A Trust Mark Issuer is a Federation Entity that issues Trust marks.</t>
        <t>
          A Trust Mark Owner is an Entity the owns the right to a Trust Mark
          identifier.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Trust Marks are signed by a federation-accredited
          authority. All Trust Mark issuers MUST be represented in the
          federation by an Entity. The fact that a Trust Mark Issuer is
          accepted by the federation is expressed in the
          <spanx style="verb">trust_marks_issuers</spanx> claim of the
          Trust Anchor.
        </t>

        <t>
          The key used by the Trust Mark
          Issuer to sign its Trust Marks MUST be one of the private keys
          related to its
          <spanx style="verb">Federation Entity Keys</spanx>.
        </t>

        <t>
          Note that a federation MAY allow an Entity to self-sign
          some Trust Marks.
        </t>

        <t>
          Trust Mark JWTs MUST be explicitly typed by setting the
          <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> header parameter to
          <spanx style="verb">trust-mark+jwt</spanx>. This is done to prevent
          cross-JWT confusion (see <xref target="RFC8725"/>, section 3.11).

            may not match the Trust Mark Issuer due to administrative or
            technical requirements. Take as an example vehicle
            inspection. Vehicle inspection is a procedure mandated by national
            or subnational governments in many countries, in which a vehicle is
            inspected to ensure that it conforms to regulations governing
            safety, emissions, or both. The bodies that mandates the inspection
            does not perform them instead there may be commercial companies
            performing this check and which then issues the Trust Mark.

          <t>
            The fact that a Trust Mark is issued by a Trust Mark Issuer that is
            not the owner of the Trust Mark is in the Trust Mark expressed by adding a
            signed JWT to the <spanx style="verb">delegation</spanx> claim.
            The format of the signed JWT is as described below.

            that are not the owner of the Trust Mark ID then the information

    <section
            title="Obtaining Federation Entity Configuration Information"
            anchor="federation_configuration">
      <t>
        The Entity Configuration of every participant SHOULD be exposed at a well-known endpoint.
        The configuration endpoint is found using the
        <xref target="RFC8615">Well-Known URIs</xref>
        specification, with the suffix
        <spanx style="verb">openid-federation</spanx>. The scheme, host, and port
        are taken directly from the Entity Identifier combined with the following
        path: <spanx style="verb">/.well-known/openid-federation</spanx>.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the Entity Identifier contains a path, it is concatenated after
        <spanx style="verb">/.well-known/openid-federation</spanx>
        in the same
        manner
        that path components are concatenated to the well-known identifier in
        the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata
        <xref target="RFC8414"/>
        specification.
        Of course, in real multi-tenant deployments, in which the Entity Identifier
        might be of the form
        <spanx style="verb">https://multi-tenant-service.example.com/my-tenant-identifier</spanx>
        the tenant is very likely to not have control over the path
        <spanx style="verb">https://multi-tenant-service.example.com/.well-known/openid-federation/my-tenant-identifier</spanx>
        whereas it is very likely to have control over the path
        <spanx style="verb">https://multi-tenant-service.example.com/my-tenant-identifier/.well-known/openid-federation</spanx>.
        Therefore, if using the configuration endpoint at the URL with the
        tenant path
        after the well-known part fails,
        it is RECOMMENDED that callers retry at the URL with the tenant path
        before the well-known part
        (even though this violates <xref target="RFC8615"/>).
      </t>
      <t>
        Entities SHOULD make an Entity Configuration document
        available at the configuration endpoint.
        There is only one exception to this
        rule and that is for an RP that only does Explicit Registration.
        Since it posts the Entity Configuration to the OP during client
        registration, the OP has everything it needs from the RP.
      </t>
      <section title="Federation Entity Configuration Request">
        <t>
          An Entity Configuration document MUST be queried using an
          HTTP GET request at the previously specified path.
          The requesting party would make the following request to the Entity
          <spanx style="verb">https://openid.sunet.se</spanx>
          to obtain its configuration information:

          If the Entity is an Intermediate Entity or a Trust Anchor, the
          response MUST contain metadata for a federation Entity
          (<spanx style="verb">federation_entity</spanx>).
        </t>
        <t>
          A successful response MUST use the HTTP status code 200
          and the content type set to

          to make it clear that the response contains a signed Entity Statement.
          In case of an error, the response
          SHOULD be produced in accordance with what is defined in

            <spanx style="verb">resolve-response+jwt</spanx>.
            This is done to prevent

            The key used by the resolver to sign the response MUST be one of its
            Federation Entity Keys.

        <section title="Considerations">
          <t>
            The basic assumption of this specification is that an Entity
            should have direct trust in no one except the Trust Anchor
            and its own capabilities.

            However, Entities may establish a kind of
            transistive trust in other Entities. For example, the
            Trust Anchor states who its Subordinates are
            and Entities may choose to trust these.

            If a party uses the resolve service of another Entity
            to obtain federation data, it is trusting
            the resolver to perform the validation of the cryptographically
            protected metadata correctly and to provide it with authentic results.

          the Trust Anchor or Intermediate issues Entity Statements.

		  As Trust Mark issuer,
          the endpoint MAY list the Subordinates for which Trust Marks
          have been issued and are still valid, if the issuer
          exposing this endpoint supports Trust Mark filtering, as

          Each Federation Entity MAY publish its previously used
          federation public keys at the endpoint
          <spanx style="verb">
            /.well-known/openid-federation-historical-jwks

          The purpose of this endpoint is to provide
          the list of keys previously used by the Federation Entity
          in order to provide non-repudiation of statements signed by
          it after key rotation. This endpoint also discloses the
          reason for the retraction of the keys, whether they were
          expired or revoked, including the reason for the revocation.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that an expired key can be later additionally marked as
          revoked, to indicate a key compromise event discovered
          after the expiration of the key.
        </t>
        <t>
          The publishing of the historical keys guarantees that Trust Chains
          will remain verifiable and usable as inputs to trust decisions
          after the key expiration, unless the key becomes revoked
          for a security reason.

          <!--
            introduce the problem
          -->
          <t>
            The Federation Historical Keys endpoint
            solves the problem of verifying historical
            Trust Chains when the Federation Entity Keys
            are changed, due to expiry or revocation.
          </t>

          <!--
            describe the concept
          -->
          <t>
            The Federation Historical Keys endpoint
            publishes the list of public keys used in the past by a Federation Entity.
            The given public keys are needed by all the Entities
            to verify the Trust Chains evaluated in the past with the
            Federation Entity Keys not published anymore in the Federation Entity's
            Entity Configuration.
          </t>

          <!--
            give the technical details.
          -->
          <t>
            Federation Historical Keys endpoint response contains a signed JWT
            that attests all the expired and revoked Federation Entity Keys.
          </t>

          <!--
            more technical details.
          -->
          <t>
            On the basis of the attributes contained in the Entity Statements
            that form a Trust Chain, it MAY be also possible to verify
            the non-federation public keys used in the past by a Leaf for the
            signature operations related to the OpenID Connect
            requests and responses.
            For example an Entity Statement issued for a Leaf
            MAY also include the
            <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> claim,
            respectively in the claims
            <spanx style="verb">metadata</spanx> or
            <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx>.

            <t>
              A simple example: In the following Trust Chain the
              Federation Intermediate attests the Leaf's OpenID Connect
              <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx>
              in the Entity Statement issued for the Leaf. The result is
              a Trust Chain that contains the Leaf's OIDC Core jwks,
              needed to verify historical signature on
              Request Objects, ID Tokens and any other signed JWT issued by the Leaf,
              if it is an RP or an OP.

        from the remote peer to one or more of the configured Trust Anchors.
        After that, the Entity MUST validate the Trust Chains independently,
        and if there are multiple valid Trust Chains and if the
        application demands it, choose one.
      </t>

      <section anchor="fetching-es"
               title="Fetching Entity Statements to Establish a Trust Chain">
        <t>
          Depending on the circumstances, the consumer MAY be
          handed the remote peer's Entity Configuration, or it may
          have to fetch it by itself. If it needs to fetch it, it will use the
          process described in <xref target="federation_configuration"/>
          based on the Entity Identifier of the remote peer.
        </t>
        <t>
          The next step is to iterate through the list of
          Intermediates listed in
          <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>, ignoring the authority
          hints that end in an unknown Trust Anchor, requesting an Entity
          Configuration from each of the Intermediates.
          If the received Entity Configuration contains an authority hint, this
          process is repeated.
        </t>
        <t>
          With the list of all Intermediates and the Trust Anchor, the respective
          federation API (see <xref target="federation_endpoints"/>) is used to fetch Entity
          Statements about the Intermediates and the remote peer.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note: The consumer SHOULD NOT attempt to fetch
          Entity Statements it already has fetched during this
          process (loop prevention).
        </t>
        <t>
          A successful operation will return one or more lists of
          Entity Statements. Each of the lists terminating in a self-signed
          Entity Statement is issued by a Trust Anchor.
        </t>
        <t>
          If there is no path from the remote peer to at least one of the
          trusted Trust Anchors, then the list will be empty and there is no
          way of establishing trust in the remote peer's information. How the
          consumer deals with this is out of scope for this specification.

      <section title="Validating a Trust Chain" anchor="trust_chain_validation">
        <t>
          As described in <xref target="trust_chain"/>,
          a Trust Chain consists of an ordered list of Entity
          Statements. So whichever way the consumer has acquired the set of
          Entity Statements, it MUST now verify that it is a proper Trust Chain
          using the rules laid out in that section.
        </t>
        <t>
          To validate the chain, the following MUST be done:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              For each Entity Statement ES[j] j=i,..,0:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  Verify that the statement contains all the required claims.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Verify that <spanx style="verb">iat</spanx> has a value in the
                  past.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Verify that <spanx style="verb">exp</spanx> has a value that
                  is in the future.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              For j=0 verify that <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> ==
              <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>.
            </t>
            <t>
              For j=0,...,i-1: Verify that ES[j]['iss'] == ES[j+1]['sub']
            </t>
            <t>
              For j=0,...,i-1: Verify the signature of ES[j] using a public
              key carried in ES[j+1]['jwks'].
            </t>
            <t>
              For j == 0 verify the signature of ES[0] using a public
              key carried in ES[0]['jwks'].
            </t>
            <t>
              For j == i: verify that a) the issuer matches the configured
              identifier of a Trust Anchor and b) its signature is valid with
              the likewise configured public key of said Trust Anchor.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Verifying the signature is a much more expensive
          operation than verifying the correctness of the statement and the
          timestamps. An implementer MAY therefore choose not to verify the
          signature until all the other checks have been done.
        </t>
        <t>Consumers MAY cache Entity Statements or signature verification
          results for a given time until they expire, per
          <xref target="trust_lifetime"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that the second bullet point means that, at each step in the
          Trust Chain resolution, it MUST be verified that the signing JWK is
          also present in the <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx>
          statement claim issued by the superior.

      <section title="Choosing One of the Valid Trust Chains">
        <t>
          If multiple valid Trust Chains are found, the consumer will
          need to decide on which one to use.
        </t>
        <t>
          One simple rule would be to prefer a shorter chain over a longer one.
        </t>
        <t>Consumers MAY follow other rules according to local policy.</t>

      <t>
        As described above in <xref target="trust_lifetime"/>,
        each Trust Chain has an expiration time.
        A consumer of metadata using this specification MUST support
        refreshing a Trust Chain when it expires.
        How often a consumer SHOULD re-evaluate the Trust Chain depends on

      <section title="Redundant Retrieval of Trust Anchor Keys" anchor="TrustAnchorKeys">
        <t>
          It is RECOMMENDED that Federation Operators provide a means of retrieving the public keys
          for the Trust Anchors it administers that is independent of those Trust Anchors' Entity Configurations.
          This is intended to provide redundancy in the eventuality of the compromise of
          the Web PKI infrastructure underlying retrieval of public keys from Entity Configurations.
        </t>
        <t>
          The keys retrieved via the independent mechanism specified by the Federation Operator
          SHOULD be compared to those retrieved via the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration.
          If they do not match, both SHOULD be retrieved again.
          If they still do not match, it is indicative of a security or configuration problem.
          The appropriate remediation steps in that eventuality SHOULD be specified by the Federation Operator.

      <section title="Revocation">
        <t>
          Since the consumers are expected to check the Trust Chain at regular,

          standard revocation process. Specific federations MAY make a
          different choice and will then have to add such a process.

    <section title="OpenID Connect Communication" anchor="client_registration">
      <t>
        This section describes how the trust framework in this specification
        is used to establish trust between an RP and an OP
        that have no explicit configuration or registration in advance.
      </t>
      <t>
        There are two alternative approaches to establish trust between an
        RP and an OP, which we call Automatic and Explicit Registration.
        Members of a federation or a community
        SHOULD agree upon which one to use. While implementations should
        support both methods, deployments MAY choose to disable the use of one
        of them.
      </t>
      <t>
        Independent of whether the RP uses Automatic or Explicit Registration,
        the way that the RP learns about the OP is the same.
        It will use the procedure that is
        described in <xref target="resolving_trust"/>.
      </t>

      <section title="Automatic Registration" anchor="automatic">
        <t>
          Automatic Registration enables an RP to make Authentication Requests
          without a prior registration step with the OP.
          The OP resolves the RP's Entity Configuration from the Client ID in the Authentication Request,
          following the process defined in <xref target="resolving_trust"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Automatic Registration has the following characteristics:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              In all interactions with the OP, the RP employs its Entity Identifier as the Client ID.
              The OP retrieves the RP's Entity Configuration
              from a URL derived from the Entity Identifier, as
              described in <xref target="federation_configuration"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
              Since there is no registration step prior to the Authentication Request,

              <t>
                When the OP receives an incoming Authentication Request,
                the OP supports OpenID Connect Federation, the incoming
                Client ID
                is a valid URL, and the OP does not have the Client ID
                registered as a known
                client, then the OP SHOULD resolve the Trust
                Chains related to the requestor.
              </t>
              <t>
                An RP MAY present to the OP a Trust Chain related to itself,
                using the <xref target="trust_chain_param">trust_chain</xref>
                request parameter or the
                <xref target="trust_chain_head_param">trust_chain</xref>
                <xref target="RFC7515">JWS</xref> header parameter
                in the Request Object.

                If the OP doesn't have a valid registration for the RP or
                its registration has expired, the OP MAY use the received
                Trust Chain as a hint for which path to take from the
                Leaf Entity to the Trust Anchor.
                The OP MAY evaluate the statements in the
                <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx>
                to make its Federation Entity Discovery procedure more efficient,
                especially if the RP shows more than a single authority hint in
                its Entity Configuration.

                If the OP already has a valid registration for the RP, it MAY
                use the received Trust Chain to update the RP's registration.

                Whenever the OP uses a Trust Chain submitted by an RP, the
                OP MUST fully verify it, with every statement contained in it.

                A Trust Chain may be relied upon by the OP because it has validated
                all of its statements. This is true whether these statements
                are retrieved from their URLs or whether they
                are provided via the <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx>
                request parameter or the
                <xref target="RFC7515">JWS</xref> header parameter
                in the Request Object.
              </t>
              <t anchor="TrustChainParamAbsent">
                If the RP doesn't include the
                <xref target="trust_chain_param">trust_chain</xref>
                request parameter or the
                <xref target="RFC7515">JWS</xref> header parameter
                in the Request Object,
                or the OP doesn't support this feature, it then MUST
                validate the possible Trust Chains, starting with the RP's Entity
                Configuration as described in <xref target="fetching-es"/>,
                and resolve the RP metadata with type
                <spanx style="verb">openid_relying_party</spanx>.
              </t>
              <t>
                The OP SHOULD furthermore consider the resolved metadata of the
                RP
                and verify that it complies with the client metadata
                specification

              <t>
                Once the OP has the RP's metadata, it can verify that the client
                was actually the one sending the Authentication Request by
                verifying the signature of the Request Object using the key
                material the client published through its metadata (underneath
                <spanx style="verb">metadata/openid_relying_party</spanx>).

                This is where it diverges depending on which client

            Note that we anticipate that Automatic Registration could be employed

            If used with pure OAuth 2.0, for instance,
            Automatic Registration would occur during Authorization Requests.
            If for a particular such use case, the client does not need to be securely identified,

          This method involves performing an explicit registration step for a new client
          before the RP interacts with an OP for the first time,
          similar to the process specified by
          <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>,
          but where the client registration request contains the Entity Configuration

              An OP that supports OpenID Dynamic Client Registration as extended
              by this specification, signals this by having the claim
              <spanx style="verb">federation_registration_endpoint</spanx>
              in the OP's metadata.
            </t>
            <t>
              Given that the OP supports Explicit Registration, the RP
              progresses as follows:

            <t>
              <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                  Once it has a list of acceptable Trust Anchors to the OP,
                  it MUST choose the subset it wants to progress with. This
                  subset can be as small as one Trust Anchor, but it can also
                  contain more than one.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Using this subset of Trust Anchors, the RP will choose a set of
                  <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
                  from the hints that are available to it. Each hint MUST,
                  when used as a starting point for Trust Chain collection,
                  lead to at least one of the Trust Anchors in the subset.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The RP will now construct its Entity Configuration
                  where the metadata statement chosen is influenced by the OP's

                <t>
                  The RP MAY include its Entity Configuration
                  in a Trust Chain regarding itself.
                  The Registration Request will contain an
                  array containing the sequence of the
                  statements that compose the Trust Chain
                  between the RP that makes the request and the

                  The Entity Configuration, or the entire Trust Chain,

                    The RP MUST NOT apply metadata policies and assertions
                    from the Trust Chains that the OP provides because those
                    are not valid for the RP's metadata.
                    The RP MUST apply policies and assertions to the metadata
                    using one of its own Trust Chains that ends in the Trust
                    Anchor that the OP chose.
                    Once it has applied those policies and assertions, it can
                    then apply the policies and assertions returned from the OP.
                    This application of policies and assertions
                    is equivalent to adding the OP's metadata policies and
                    assertions to the Trust Chain in between the RP's and its
                    immediate superior's Entity Statements.
                    When the RP has applied all the metadata policies and
                    assertions to its metadata statement, it then stores
                    the result and will use the agreed-upon metadata when
                    talking to the OP.

                  <t>
                    At this point, the RP also knows which Trust Chain it should
                    use when evaluating the OP's metadata. It can therefore
                    apply the metadata policies and assertions on the OP's
                    metadata using the relevant Trust Chain and store the result
                    as the OP's metadata.

                    If the RP does not accept the received Entity Statement for
                    some reason, then it has the choice to restart the

            A client registration using the explicit method is not expected to
            be valid forever. The Entity Statements exchanged all have
            expiration times, which means that the registration will eventually
            time out. An OP can also, for administrative reasons, decide that a
            client registration is not valid anymore. An example of this could
            be the OP leaving the federation used to register an RP.
          </t>

          <t>
            The temporary nature of explicit registration means that an RP must
            expect its registration to become invalidated at any time, causing
            RP requests to the OP, such as authorization, token or UserInfo
            requests, to fail. An RP MAY devise appropriate strategies to
            re-register with the OP and restart the transaction when such a

      <section title="Differences between Automatic Registration and Explicit Registration" anchor="AutomaticVsExplicit">

          The primary differences between Automatic Registration and Explicit Registration are:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              With Automatic Registration, there is no registration step prior to the Authentication Request,
              whereas with Explicit Registration, there is.
              (<xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>
              and <xref target="RFC7591">OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration</xref>)
              also employ a prior registration step.)
            </t>
            <t>
              With Automatic Registration, the Client ID value is the RP's Entity Identifier
              and is supplied to the OP by the RP,
              whereas with Explicit Registration, a Client ID is assigned by the OP and supplied to the RP.
            </t>
            <t>
              Instead of using a Client Secret to authenticate the client, with Automatic Registration,
              the client is authenticated by means of the RP proving that it controls a private key
              corresponding to one of its Entity Configuration's public keys.

      <section title="Rationale for the Trust Chain in the Request" anchor="TrustChainParamRationale">
        <t>
          Both Automatic and Explicit Client Registration support
          the submission of the Trust Chain embedded in the Request,
          calculated by the requestor and related to itself.

          This enables the following benefits in
          a federation:

          <t anchor="MetadataUpdateHint">
            It solves the problem of OPs using RP metadata that has become stale.
            This stale data may occur when the OP uses cached RP metadata from a Trust Chain
            that hasn't reached its expiration time yet.
            The RP MAY notify the OP that a change has taken place by passing
            in the request the <xref target="trust_chain_head_param">trust_chain</xref> header parameter
            or the <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx>
            request parameter
            , thus letting the OP update its client
            registration and prevent potential temporary faults due to stale metadata.
          </t>

          <t anchor="TrustPathHint">
            It enables the RP to pass a verifiable hint for which trust path to
            take in order to build the Trust Chain. This can reduce the costs
            of RP Federation Entity Discovery for OPs in complex federations where the
            RP has multiple Trust Anchors or the Trust Chain resolution may
            result in dead-ends.
          </t>

          <t anchor="ECHint">
            It enables direct passing of the Entity Configuration, including
            any present Trust Marks, thus saving the OP from having to make
            an HTTP request to the RP
            <spanx style="verb">/.well-known/openid-federation</spanx>
            endpoint.

    <section anchor="ClaimsLanguagesAndScripts" title="Claims Languages and Scripts">
      <t>
        Human-readable Claim Values and Claim Values that reference human-readable values
        MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts.
        This specification enables such representations in the same manner as defined in
        Section 5.2 of <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>.
        The paragraphs that follow are excerpted from there.
      </t>
      <t>
        To specify the languages and scripts, <xref
              target="RFC5646">BCP47</xref> language tags are added to member names,
        delimited by a <spanx style="verb">#</spanx> character.  For example,
        <spanx style="verb">family_name#ja-Kana-JP</spanx> expresses the
        Family Name in Katakana in Japanese, which is commonly used to index
        and represent the phonetics of the Kanji representation of the same
        represented as <spanx style="verb">family_name#ja-Hani-JP</spanx>.
        As another example, both <spanx style="verb">website</spanx> and
        <spanx style="verb">website#de</spanx> Claim Values might be returned,
        referencing a Web site in an unspecified language and a Web site
        in German.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since Claim Names are case sensitive, it is strongly RECOMMENDED
        that language tag values used in Claim Names be spelled using the
        character case with which they are registered in the
        IANA "Language Subtag Registry" <xref target="IANA.Language"/>.
        In particular, language names are often spelled with lowercase characters,
        region names are spelled with uppercase characters, and
        scripts are spelled with mixed-case characters.
        However, since BCP47 language tag values are case-insensitive,
        implementations SHOULD interpret the language tag values supplied
        in a case-insensitive manner.
      </t>
      <t>
        Per the recommendations in BCP47, language tag values for Claims
        SHOULD only be as specific as necessary.
        For instance, using <spanx style="verb">fr</spanx> might be sufficient
        in many contexts, rather than <spanx style="verb">fr-CA</spanx> or
        <spanx style="verb">fr-FR</spanx>.
        Where possible, OPs SHOULD try to match requested Claim locales with
        Claims it has.  For instance, if the Client asks for a Claim with
        a <spanx style="verb">de</spanx> (German) language tag and the OP
        has a value tagged with <spanx style="verb">de-CH</spanx> (Swiss German)
        and no generic German value, it would be appropriate for the OP
        to return the Swiss German value to the Client.
        (This intentionally moves as much of the complexity of language tag
        matching to the OP as possible to simplify Clients.)

      <section title="Denial-of-Service Attack Prevention" anchor="DoS">
        <t>
          Some of the interfaces defined in this specification could be used for
          Denial-of-Service attacks (DoS), most notably, the Resolve endpoint
          (<xref target="entity_listing"/>), Explicit Client Registration
          (<xref target="explicit"/>), and
          Automatic Client Registration (<xref target="automatic"/>) can
          be exploited as vectors of HTTP propagation attacks.

          If these endpoints are provided, some adequate defense methods are required,
          such as those described below and in
          <xref target="RFC4732"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          A Trust Mark can be statically validated using the public key of its issuer.
          The static validation of the Trust Marks represents a
          filter against propagation attacks. An attacker
          could exploit the Federation Entity Discovery mechanism and use an OIDC Federation
          to propagate many HTTP requests. For each authorization request crafted
          by an anonymous client, the OP would produce approximately three HTTP requests to third parties
          in the absence of Intermediates, and at least five HTTP requests with at
          least one Intermediate. If an OP doesn't find at least one
          valid Trust Mark in an Entity Configuration, it should reject the request and
          temporary ban the requestor.
        </t>
        <t>
          If client authentication is not demanded at the Resolve endpoint
          then incoming requests should not result in the immediate
          collection (Federation Entity Discovery process) and evaluation of Trust Chains by default.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Unsigned Error Messages" anchor="UnsignedError">
        <t>
          One of the fundamental design goals of this protocol is to
          protect messages end-to-end. This can not be accomplished by demanding
          TLS since TLS, in lots of cases, is not end-to-end but ends in a HTTPS
          to HTTP Reverse Proxy.
          Allowing unsigned error messages therefore opens up an attack
          vector for someone who wants to run a Denial of Service attack.
          This is not specific to OpenID Connect Federation but equally valid for
          other protocols when HTTPS to HTTP reverse proxies are used.

      <t>
        Let us assume the following: The project LIGO would like to offer access
        to its wiki to all OPs in eduGAIN. LIGO is registered with the InCommon
        federation.
      </t>

      </figure>
      <t>
        Both SWAMID and InCommon are identity federations in their own right.
        They also have in common that they are both members of
        the eduGAIN federation.
      </t>
      <t>
        SWAMID and InCommon are different in how they register Entities.
        SWAMID registers organizations and lets the organizations register
        Entities that belong to the organization, while InCommon registers all
        Entities directly and not beneath any organization Entity.
        Hence the differences in depth in the federations.
      </t>
      <t>
        Let us assume a researcher from Umea University would like to
        login to
        the LIGO Wiki. At the Wiki, the researcher will use some kind of
        discovery service to find the home identity provider (op.umu.se)
      </t>
      <t>
        Once the RP part of the Wiki knows which OP it SHOULD talk to, it has
        to find out a couple of things about the OP. All of those things
        can be found in the metadata. But finding the metadata is not enough;
        the RP also has to trust the metadata.
      </t>
      <t>
        Let us make a detour and start with what it takes to build a federation.
      </t>

      <section title="Setting Up a Federation" anchor="federation_intro">
        <t>
          These are the steps to set up a federation infrastructure:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Generation of signing keys. These must be public/private key pairs.
            </t>
            <t>
              Set up a signing service that can sign JWTs/Entity Statements
              using the Federation Entity Keys.
            </t>
            <t>
              Set up web services that can publish signed Entity Statements,
              one for the URL corresponding to the federation's Entity Identifier returning
              an Entity Configuration and the other one providing the fetch
              Entity Statement endpoint, as described in
              <xref target="fetch_statement"/>.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Once the previous requirements have been satisfied, a Federation Operator
          can add Entities to the federation.
          Adding an Entity comes down to:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Providing the Entity with the
              federation's Entity Identifier and the public part of the key pairs used
              by the federation operator for signing Entity Statements.
            </t>
            <t>
              Getting the Entity's Entity Identifier and the JWKS that the Entity
              plans to publish in its Entity Configuration.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Before the federation operator starts adding Entities, there must
          be policies on who can be part of the federation and the
          layout of the federation. Is it supposed to be a one-layer federation
          like InCommon, a two-layer one like the SWAMID federation,
          or a multi-layer federation?
          The federation may also want to think about implementing other
          policies using the federation policy framework,
          as described in <xref target="federation_policy"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          With the federation in place, things can start happening.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="The LIGO Wiki Discovers the OP's Metadata"
               anchor="op_discovery">
        <t>
          Federation Entity Discovery is a sequence of steps that starts with the RP
          fetching the Entity Configuration of the Leaf Entity (in this case,
          https://op.umu.se) using the process defined in
          <xref target="federation_configuration"/>.
          What follows after that is this sequence of steps:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Pick out the immediate superior Entities using the authority
              hints
            </t>
            <t>
              Fetch the configuration for each such Entity. This uses the
              process defined in
              <xref target="federation_configuration"/>
            </t>
            <t>
              Using the fetch endpoint of the superiors to
              ask for information about the Subordinate Entity
              <xref target="fetch_statement"/>.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          How many times this has to be repeated depends on the depth of the
          federation. What follows below is the result of each step the RP
          has to take to find the OP's metadata using the federation setup
          described above.
        </t>
        <t>
          When building the Trust Chain, the Entity Statements issued
          by a superior about its Subordinate are used together with the
          Entity Configuration issued by the Leaf.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Entity Configuration concerning Intermediates is not
          part of the Trust Chain.
        </t>
        <section title="Configuration Information for op.umu.se">
          <t>The LIGO WIKI RP fetches the Entity Configuration from the
            OP (op.umu.se)
            using the process defined in <xref
                    target="federation_configuration"/>.
          </t>
          <figure>

              <vspace/>
              No negotiation between the RP and the OP is made regarding
              what features the client SHOULD use in future communication are
              done. The RP's published metadata filtered by the chosen trust
              chain's
              metadata policies defines the metadata that is to be used.

            <t hangText="Explicit">

              <spanx style="verb">federation_registration_endpoint</spanx>,
              which provides the RP's metadata. The OP MAY return a
              metadata policy that adds restrictions over and above what the

              Once the Trust Chain and the final Relying Party metadata
              have been obtained, the OpenID Provider has
              everything needed to validate the signature of the
              Request Object in the Authentication Request, using the
              public keys made available at the

            Once the OP has the Entity Configuration, it proceeds with the same
            sequence of steps as laid out in <xref target="op_discovery"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The OP will end up with the same RP metadata described in
            <xref target="rp_metadata_eval"/>, but it now can
            return a metadata policy that it wants to be applied to the RP's
            metadata. This metadata policy will be combined with the
            Trust Chain's combined metadata policy before being applied to the
            RP's metadata.
          </t>
          <t>
            If we assume that the OP does not support refresh tokens,
            it MAY want to add a metadata policy that says:
