    <abstract>
      <t>
        A federation can be expressed as an agreement between parties that trust each other.
        In bilateral federations, direct trust can be established between
        two organizations belonging to the same federation.
        In a multilateral federation, bilateral agreements might not be practical,
        in which case, trust can be mediated by a third party.
        That is the model used in this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        An Entity in the federation must be able to trust that other Entities
        it interacts with belong to the same federation.
        It must also be able to trust that the information the other Entities
        publish about themselves has not been tampered with during transport
        and that it adheres to the federation's policies.
          </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines basic components used to build
        multilateral federations and describes how to apply them when
        the underlying authentication protocol used is OpenID Connect or
        the underlying authorization protocol is OAuth 2.0.
        However, these components can also be
        used for trust establishment with other application protocols.

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This specification describes how two Entities that would like to
        interact can establish trust between them by means of a trusted third party
        called a Trust Anchor.
        A Trust Anchor is an Entity whose main purpose is to issue statements
        about Entities.
        An identity federation can be realized using this specification using
        one or more levels of authorities.
        Examples of authorities are federation operators, organizations,
        departments within organizations, and individual sites.
        This
        specification provides the basic technical trust infrastructure building
        blocks needed to create a dynamic and distributed trust network, such as a
        federation.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that this specification only concerns itself with how Entities
        in a federation get to know about each other. An organization MAY
        be represented by more than one Entity in a federation. An Entity
        MAY also belong to more than one federation. Determining that two
        Entities belong to the same federation is the basis for
        establishing trust between them in this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        Of course, the word "trust" is also used in the vernacular to
        encompass confidence in the security, reliability, and integrity of entities
        and their actions. This kind trust is often established through
        empirical proof, such as past performance, security certifications,
        or transparent operational practices, which demonstrate a track
        record of adherence to security standards and ethical conduct.
        To be clear, this broader meaning of trust, while important,
        is largely beyond the scope of what this specification accomplishes.
      </t>

	  Below is an example of two federations rooted at two different
	  Trust Anchors with some members in common.

	  Every Entity is able to establish mutual trust with any
	  other Entity by means of having at least one
	  common Trust Anchor between them.

        The basic component is the Entity Statement, which is a cryptographically
        signed <xref target="RFC7519">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>.
        A set of Entity Statements can form a path from an Entity
	(typically a Leaf Entity) to
        a Trust Anchor. Entity Configurations
        issued by Entities about themselves control the Trust Chain
        resolution process.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Entity Configuration of a Leaf or Intermediate Entity contains one or more
        references to its Immediate Superiors in the
	<spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx> parameter
	described in <xref target="authority_hints"/>.
        These references can be used to download the Entity Configuration of each Immediate Superior.
        One or more Entity Configurations are traversed during the Federation Entity Discovery
        until the Trust Anchor is reached.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Trust Anchor and its Intermediates issue Entity Statements
        about their Immediate Subordinate Entities called Subordinate Statements.
	The sequence of Entity Configurations
        and Subordinate Statements that validate the relationship between
        a Superior and a Subordinate, along a path towards the Trust Anchor,
        forms the proof that the subject of Trust Chain
	(typically a Leaf Entity) is a member of
        the federation rooted at the Trust Anchor.
      </t>
      <t>
        The chain that links the statements to one another is verified with
        the signature of each statement, as described in <xref target="trust_chain"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Once there is a verified Trust Chain, the federation policy is applied
        and the metadata for the Trust Chain subject
	within the Federation is derived,
        as described in <xref target="federation_policy"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification deals with trust operations;
        it does not cover or touch protocol operations
        other than metadata derivation and exchange.
        In OpenID Connect terms, these are the protocol operations specified in
        <xref target="OpenID.Discovery">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</xref>
        and
        <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
        OpenID Connect is used in many of the examples in this
        specification, however this does not mean that this specification can only be used
        with OpenID Connect. On the contrary, it can also be
        used to build federations for any other protocols.

      <section title="Cryptographic Trust Mechanism" anchor="CryptographicTrustMechanism">
	<t>
	  The objects defined by this specification
	  that are used to establish cryptographic trust between participants
	  are secured as signed JWTs using public key cryptography.
	  In particular, the keys used for securing these objects are managed by
	  the Entities controlling those objects, with the public keys securing them
	  being distributed through those objects themselves.
	  This kind of trust mechanism has been utilized by
	  research and academic federations for over a decade.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Note that this cryptographic trust mechanism intentionally does not rely on
	  Web PKI / TLS certificates for signing keys.
	  Which TLS certificates are considered trusted can vary considerably between systems
	  depending upon which certificate authorities are considered trusted
	  and there are have been notable examples of ostensibly trusted certificates being compromised.
	  For those reasons, this specification explicitly eschews reliance on Web PKI
	  in favor of self-managed public keys, in this case,
	  keys represented as JSON Web Keys (JWKs) <xref target="RFC7517"/>.

          The issuer of the JWT is the party that issued the Entity Statement.
          All Entities in a federation publish an Entity Statement about themselves
	  called an Entity Configuration.
	  Superior Entities in a federation publish Entity Statements about
	  their Immediate Subordinate Entities called Subordinate Statements.
        </t>
        <t>
          Entity Statement JWTs MUST be explicitly typed, by setting the
          <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> header parameter to
          <spanx style="verb">entity-statement+jwt</spanx> to prevent
          cross-JWT confusion, per Section 3.11 of <xref target="RFC8725"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Entity Statement is signed using one of the private keys of the issuer
          Entity in the form of a <xref target="RFC7515">JSON Web Signature
          (JWS)</xref>.
          Implementations SHOULD support signature verification with
          the RSA SHA-256 algorithm because OpenID Connect Core
          requires support for it (<spanx style="verb">alg</spanx>
          value of <spanx style="verb">RS256</spanx>).
          Federations MAY also specify different mandatory-to-implement algorithms.
        </t>
	<t>
	  Entity Statement JWTs MUST include the
	  <spanx style="verb">kid</spanx> (Key ID) header parameter
	  with its value being the Key ID of the signing key used.

          A Trust Chain begins with an Entity Configuration
	  that is the subject of the Trust Chain,
	  which is typically a Leaf Entity.
          The Trust Chain has zero or more Subordinate Statements
          issued by Intermediates about their Immediate Subordinates,
          and includes the Subordinate Statement issued by the
          Trust Anchor about the top-most Intermediate
          (if there are Intermediates) or the Trust Chain subject
          (if there are no Intermediates).
          The Trust Chain logically always ends with the
          Entity Configuration of the Trust Anchor,
	  even though it MAY be omitted from
	  the JSON array representing the Trust Chain in some cases.
        </t>
        <t>
	  The Trust Chain contains the configuration of the federation
	  as it applies to the Trust Chain subject
          at the time of the evaluation of the chain.
        </t>
        <t>
          A simple example: If we have an RP that belongs to Organization A
          that is a member of Federation F, the Trust Chain for such a setup
          will contain the following Entity Statements:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              an Entity Configuration about the RP published by itself,
            </t>
            <t>
              a Subordinate Statement about the RP published by Organization A,
            </t>
            <t>
              a Subordinate Statement about Organization A published by the Trust Anchor for F,
            </t>
	    <t>
	      an Entity Configuration about the Trust Anchor for F published by itself.
	    </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
	  Let us refer to the Entity Statements in the Trust Chain as
	  ES[j], where j = 0,...,i,
	  with 0 being the index of the first Entity Statement
	  and i being the zero-based index of the last.
	  Then:
          <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
	      ES[0] (the Entity Configuration of the Trust Chain subject)
	      is signed using a key in ES[0]["jwks"].
	    </t>
            <t>
	      The <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> claim in an Entity Statement
	      is equal to the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> claim in the next.
	      Restating this symbolically,
	      for each j = 0,...,i-1,
	      ES[j]["iss"] == ES[j+1]["sub"].
            </t>
            <t>
	      An Entity Statement is signed using a key from
	      the <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> claim in the next.
	      Restating this symbolically,
	      for each j = 0,...,i-1,
	      ES[j] is signed by a key in ES[j+1]["jwks"].
            </t>
	    <t>
	      ES[i] (the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration in the Trust Chain)
	      is signed using a key in ES[i]["jwks"].
	    </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
	  The Trust Anchor's public keys are used to verify the signatures on
	  ES[i] (the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration) and
	  ES[i-1] (the Trust Anchor's Subordinate Statement about its
	  Immediate Subordinate in the Trust Chain).
	  The Trust Anchor's public keys are distributed
	  to Entities that need to verify a
          Trust Chain in some secure out-of-band way not described in this
          document.
        </t>

	<section title="Beginning and Ending Trust Chains"
		 anchor="trust-chain-ends">
	  <t>
	    A Trust Chain begins with the Entity Configuration of an Entity
	    for which trust is being established.
	    This is the subject of the Trust Chain.
	    This Entity typically plays a protocol role,
	    such as being an OpenID Provider or OpenID Relying Party.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    While such Entities are typically Leaf Entities,
	    other topologies are possible.
	    For instance, an Entity might simultaneously be an OpenID Provider
	    and an Intermediate Entity, with OpenID Relying Parties
	    and/or other Intermediates being Subordinate to it.
	    This is a case in which the subject of a Trust Chain
	    would not be a Leaf Entity.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    A Trust Chain ends with the Entity Configuration of a Trust Anchor.
	    While Trust Anchors typically have no Superiors,
	    a Trust Anchor will have a Superior when the Trust Anchor
	    also acts as an Intermediate Entity in another federation.
	    This will be the case when there is a hierarchy of federations.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Thus, while it is typical for a Trust Chain to end with
	    a Trust Anchor with no Superiors,
	    there are situations in which the Trust Chain will end with
	    a Trust Anchor that nonetheless has Superior Entities.
	  </t>

            The following is an example of a Trust Chain consisting of
            a Leaf's Entity Configuration and Subordinate Statements issued
            by an Intermediate Entity and a Trust Anchor. It shows
            the relationship between the three Entities,
	    their Entity Configurations, and their Subordinate Statements.
	    The Subordinate Statements are obtained from the
            <spanx style="verb">federation_fetch_endpoint</spanx> of
            the subject's Immediate Superior. The URL of the
            <spanx style="verb">federation_fetch_endpoint</spanx> is
            discovered in the Immediate Superior's Entity Configuration.
            Note that the first member of the Trust Chain (the Leaf)
            is depicted at the bottom of the diagram and that the last
            member (the Trust Anchor) is depicted at the top.

          The <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> JWS header parameter is a

          and the selected Trust Anchor, sorted as shown in <xref target="trust_chain"/>.
          The Trust Chain contains the public key used to verify the
          <xref target="RFC7515">JWS</xref>.
          The issuer of the JWS SHOULD select the Trust Anchor that it has in common

          However, there are exceptions to this rule. The
          Entity Configurations and Subordinate Statements MUST NOT
          contain the <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx>  header parameter,

          the Authorization Signed Request Object SHOULD NOT contain the

	As described in <xref target="entity-statement"/>,

	claim of an Entity Statement, whose value is a JSON object.
	The member names of this object are Entity Type Identifiers,
	as specified in <xref target="entity_types"/>.
	The metadata data structure following each Entity Type Identifier is a JSON object;
	it MAY be the empty JSON object <spanx style="verb">{}</spanx>,
	which may be the case when Superiors supply any needed metadata values.
      </t>

	Top-level JSON object members in the metadata data structures MAY use
	any JSON value other than <spanx style="verb">null</spanx>;
	the use of <spanx style="verb">null</spanx> is prohibited to prevent likely

	      This is done via request authentication methods.
	      These methods achieve this by proving that

	      The <spanx style="verb">request_authentication_methods_supported</spanx>

	      where the request authentication occurs.
	      This MAY be either at
	      the OP's Authorization Endpoint or
	      the OP's Pushed Authorization Request (PAR) endpoint.

	      However, there may be circumstances in which is it desirable to use multiple
	      JWK Set representations, such as when an Entity is in multiple federations and the
	      federations have different policies about the JWK Set representation to be used.
	      When multiple JWK Set representations are used, the keys present in each
	      representation SHOULD be the same.  Even if they are not completely the
	      same at a given instant in time (which may be the case during key rollover operations),
	      implementations MUST make them consistent in a timely manner.

            OpenID Federation enables the definition of metadata policies with
            the following properties:

            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Hierarchy">
                <vspace/>
                Once applied to a metadata parameter, a metadata policy cannot be
                repealed or made more permissive by Intermediate Entities that are
                subordinate in the Trust Chain.
                <vspace/>
                The hierarchy of policies is preserved in nested federations where
                a Trust Anchor in one federation acts as an Intermediate Entity in
                another federation.
              </t>

	      <t hangText="Equal Opportunity">
		<vspace/>
		All Superior Entities in a Trust Chain can contribute to metadata policies
		of the Trust Chain subject on an equal basis.
		For instance, any Intermediate can further restrict the metadata
		of its Subordinates relative to what its Superiors specified.

                <vspace/>
                Just like metadata, a metadata policy is bound to a specific
                Entity Type. This ensures policies for different Entity Types are
                independent and isolated from one another.
                <vspace/>
                Policies are expressed at the level of individual metadata
                parameters. The policies for a given Entity Type metadata
                parameter are thus independent and isolated from those for other
                parameters.
                <vspace/>
                When a Trust Anchor or an Intermediate Entity defines a metadata
                policy for an Entity Type, it applies to the metadata of all
                Subordinate Entities of that type in the Trust Chain.
                <vspace/>
                Because the place to define a policy is the Subordinate Statement
                and every Entity Statement is issued for a specific subject, a
                federation authority can choose to define a common Entity Type
                metadata policy for all its Subordinates, or specific Entity Type
                metadata policies for specific Subordinates.

                A policy operates by performing a check, a modification, or both
                on a given metadata parameter. This specification defines a set
                of standard operators, described in
                <xref target="standard_metadata_policy_operators"/>. A
                federation MAY specify and use additional operators, provided

              If a policy error or another error is encountered during the

              MUST be considered invalid.

            <section title="Resolution" anchor="metadata_policy_resolution">

              <t>
                The metadata policy for a Trust Chain is determined by the
                sequence of the present <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx>
                claims of the Subordinate Statements that make up the chain.
              </t>

              <t>
                The resolution process MUST first gather the names of all policy
                operators other than the standard ones defined in
                <xref target="standard_metadata_policy_operators"/> that are
                declared as critical. This is done by checking each Subordinate
                Statement in the Trust Chain for the optional
                <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy_crit</spanx> claim,
                described in <xref target="entity-statement"/>, and collecting
                any operator names that are found in it.
              </t>

              <t>
                The resolution process proceeds by iterating through the
                Subordinate Statements. The sequence of this iteration is
                crucial - it MUST begin with the Subordinate Statement issued by
                the most Superior Entity and end with the Subordinate Statement
                issued by the Immediate Superior of the Trust Chain subject.
              </t>

              <t>
                An important procedure during the iteration is the
                <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx> validation. It MUST
                ensure the data structure is compliant and that every metadata
                parameter policy contains only allowed operator combinations, as
                described in <xref target="metadata_policy_operators"/>, and in
                accordance with the specifications of the operators. It MUST be
                also ensured the <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx>
                contains no operators that cannot be understood and processed
                whose names are among the collected
                <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy_crit</spanx> values. An
                unsuccessful validation MUST result in a policy error.
              </t>

              <t>
                At each iteration step, the Subordinate Statement MUST be checked
                for the presence of a <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx>
                claim. The first encountered
                <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx> MUST be validated as
                described above, after which it becomes the current metadata
                policy.
              </t>

              <t>
                If the iteration yields a next subordinate
                <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx> claim, it MUST be
                validated as described above, then merged into the current
                metadata policy.

              <t>
                If a metadata policy was resolved for the Trust Chain, for every
                Entity Type metadata and metadata parameter for which a
                corresponding metadata parameter policy is present, the included
                policy operators MUST be applied as described in
                <xref target="metadata_policy_operators"/> and in accordance with
                the specifications of the operators. The operators MUST be
                applied to the metadata parameter in a sequence that is
                determined by the absolute or relative order specified for each
                operator.
              </t>

              <t>
                If the application of metadata policies results in illegal or
                otherwise incorrect metadata, then the metadata MUST be regarded
                as broken and MUST NOT be used.
              </t>

              <t>
                The Trust Chain subject is responsible to verify that it is
                able to support and comply with the metadata that results from
                the application of federation metadata policies. For instance,
                this may involve a check that cryptographic algorithms required
                by the resulting metadata are supported. When metadata policies
                change, Trust Chain subjects may need to reevaluate their
                support and compliance.

            A <spanx style="verb">max_path_length</spanx> constraint of zero

            That is, the domain name constraint ".example.com" is satisfied by both
            host.example.com and my.host.example.com. However, the domain name constraint
            ".example.com" is not satisfied by "example.com". When the
            domain name constraint does not begin with a period, it specifies a host.

	  Per the definition in <xref target="Terminology"/>,
	  Trust Marks are statements of conformance to sets of criteria
	  determined by an accreditation authority.
	  Trust Marks used by this specification are signed JWTs.
	  Entity Statements MAY include Trust Marks,
	  as described in the <spanx style="verb">trust_marks</spanx>
	  claim definition in <xref target="entity-statement"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
	  A Trust Mark issuer is a Federation Entity that issues Trust Marks.
          A Trust Mark owner is an Entity that owns the right to a Trust Mark
          identifier.
        </t>
        <t>
          Trust Marks are signed by a federation-accredited
          authority called a Trust Mark issuer.
	  All Trust Mark issuers MUST be represented in the
          federation by an Entity. The fact that a Trust Mark issuer is
          accepted by the federation is expressed in the
          <spanx style="verb">trust_mark_issuers</spanx> claim of the
          Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration.
        </t>
        <t>
          The key used by the Trust Mark
          issuer to sign its Trust Marks MUST be one of the private keys
          in its set of
          Federation Entity Keys.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Trust Mark JWTs MUST include the
	  <spanx style="verb">kid</spanx> (Key ID) header parameter
	  with its value being the Key ID of the signing key used.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that a federation MAY allow an Entity to self-sign
          Trust Marks.
        </t>
        <t>
          Trust Mark JWTs MUST be explicitly typed by setting the
          <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> header parameter to
          <spanx style="verb">trust-mark+jwt</spanx> to prevent
          cross-JWT confusion, per Section 3.11 of <xref target="RFC8725"/>.

        <section title="Trust Mark Delegation" anchor="trust_mark_delegation">
          <t>
            There will be cases where the owner of a Trust Mark for some reason
            may not match the Trust Mark issuer due to administrative or
            technical requirements. Take as an example vehicle
            inspection. Vehicle inspection is a procedure mandated by national
            or subnational governments in many countries, in which a vehicle is
            inspected to ensure that it conforms to regulations governing
            safety, emissions, or both. The body that mandates the inspections
            does not perform them; instead, there may be commercial companies
            performing the inspections, after which they issue the Trust Mark.
          </t>
          <t>
            The fact that a Trust Mark is issued by a Trust Mark issuer that is
            not the owner of the Trust Mark is expressed by including
	    a <spanx style="verb">delegation</spanx> claim in the Trust Mark,
	    whose value is a signed JWT.
            The format of the delegation JWT is described below.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the Federation Operator knows that Trust Marks with a
            certain Trust Mark identifier may legitimately be issued by Trust Mark issuers

          <t>
            Note that the Entity representing the accreditation authority
            SHOULD be well known and trusted for a given Trust Mark identifier.
            A Trust Anchor MAY publish a list of accreditation authorities
            of Trust Marks that SHOULD be trusted by other Entities.
            A Trust Anchor uses the <spanx style="verb">trust_mark_issuers</spanx> claim
            in its Entity Configuration to publish this information.
          </t>
          <t>
            If a Trust Mark issuer is issuing Trust Marks on behalf of a
            Trust Mark owner, then the Trust Anchor MUST publish the
            connection between the Trust Mark identifier
	    and the corresponding Trust Mark issuer in the
            <spanx style="verb">trust_mark_issuers</spanx> claim. This
            signifies that the Trust Anchor has validated
            the Trust Mark owner and that the
            Trust Mark owner has delegated the right to issue Trust Marks
            with a designated Trust Mark identifier to a specified Trust Mark issuer.
          </t>
          <t>
            Trust Marks that are not recognized within a federation SHOULD be ignored when
            evaluating trust in the Entity that presented them. Such Trust Marks can
            appear for various reasons, such as the Entity Configuration including Trust Marks
            associated with another federation, or Trust Marks intended for specific
            purposes or Entity audiences.
          </t>
          <t>
            An Entity MAY choose, at its own discretion, to utilize Trust Marks presented
            to it that are not recognized within the federation, and where the
            accreditation authority is established by some out-of-band mechanism.

    <section title="Federation Endpoints" anchor="federation_endpoints">
      <t>
        The federation endpoints of an Entity can be found in the
        configuration response as described in
        <xref target="federation_configuration"/>
        or by other means.
      </t>
      <t>
	For all federation endpoints, additional request parameters
	beyond those initially specified MAY be defined and used.
	If they are not understood, they MUST be ignored.
      </t>

      <section title="Fetching a Subordinate Statement" anchor="fetch_endpoint">
        <t>
	  The fetch endpoint is used to collect Subordinate Statements
          one-by-one when assembling Trust Chains.
	  An Entity with Subordinates MUST expose a fetch endpoint.
	  An Entity MUST publish Subordinate Statements about its
	  Immediate Subordinates via its fetch endpoint.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The fetch endpoint location is published in
	  the Entity's <spanx style="verb">federation_entity</spanx> metadata
	  in the <spanx style="verb">federation_fetch_endpoint</spanx> parameter
	  defined in <xref target="federation_entity"/>.
	  Since this endpoint is used when building and validating Trust Chains,
	  its location MUST be available before metadata and metadata policies
	  from Superiors can be applied.
	  Therefore, this endpoint MUST be published directly in Entity Configuration
	  metadata and not in Subordinate Statements.
        </t>
        <t>
          To fetch a Subordinate Statement, one needs to know the
          identifier of the Entity to ask (the issuer), the fetch
          endpoint of that Entity, and the Entity Identifier of the
          subject of the Subordinate Statement.
	  The issuer is normally the Immediate Superior of the
          subject of the Subordinate Statement.
        </t>

            An issuer that provides its Trust Chain within the resolve
            response makes it evident that it is part of the same
            federation as the subject of the response. Thus,
            when the Trust Chains of both the issuer and the subject
            are available and the Federation Historical Keys endpoint is
            provided by the Trust Anchor, the resolve response becomes a long-lived
            attestation; it can be always verified, even
            when the Federation Keys change in the future.
          </t>

            The response SHOULD contain the

          <t>
            The basic assumption of this specification is that an Entity
            should have direct trust in no one except the Trust Anchor
            and its own capabilities.
            However, Entities may establish a kind of
            transitive trust in other Entities. For example, the
            Trust Anchor states who its Immediate Subordinates are
            and Entities may choose to trust them.
            If a party uses the resolve service of another Entity
            to obtain federation data, it is trusting
            the resolver to perform validation of the cryptographically
            protected metadata correctly and to provide it with authentic results.

          Each Federation Entity MAY publish its previously used
	  Federation Entity Keys at the historical keys endpoint
	  defined in <xref target="federation_entity"/>.
          The purpose of this endpoint is to provide
          the list of keys previously used by the Federation Entity
          to provide non-repudiation of statements signed by
          it after key rotation. This endpoint also discloses the
          reason for the retraction of the keys and whether they were
          expired or revoked, including the reason for the revocation.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that an expired key can be later additionally marked as
          revoked, to indicate a key compromise event discovered
          after the expiration of the key.
        </t>
        <t>
          The publishing of the historical keys guarantees that Trust Chains
          will remain verifiable and usable as inputs to trust decisions
          after the key expiration, unless the key becomes revoked
          for a security reason.

            introduce the problem
          -->
          <t>
            The Federation Historical Keys endpoint
            solves the problem of verifying historical
            Trust Chains when the Federation Entity Keys
            have changed, either due to expiration or revocation.
          </t>

          <!--
            describe the concept
          -->
          <t>
            The Federation Historical Keys endpoint
            publishes the list of public keys used in the past by the Entity.
            These keys are needed
            to verify Trust Chains created in the past with
            Entity keys no longer published in the Entity's
            Entity Configuration.
          </t>

          <!--
            give the technical details.
          -->
          <t>
            The Federation Historical Keys endpoint response contains a signed JWT
            that attests to all the expired and revoked Entity keys.
          </t>

          <!--
            more technical details.
          -->
          <t>
            Based on the attributes contained in the Entity Statements
            that form a Trust Chain, it MAY be also possible to verify
            the non-federation public keys used in the past by Leaf Entities for
            signature operations for OpenID Connect
            requests and responses.
            For example, an Entity Statement issued for a Leaf
            MAY also include the
            <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> claim for the Leaf's Entity Types,
	    in its
            <spanx style="verb">metadata</spanx> or
            <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx> claims.
	  </t>
            <t>
              A simple example: In the following Trust Chain, the
              Federation Intermediate attests to the Leaf's OpenID Connect RP
	      <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx>
              in the Subordinate Statement issued about the Leaf. The result is
              a Trust Chain that contains the Leaf's OpenID Connect RP JWK Set,
              needed to verify historical signature on
              Request Objects and any other signed JWT issued by the Leaf as an RP.
	      This example Trust Chain contains:
              <list style="numbers">
                <t>

	  Client authentication with <spanx style="verb">private_key_jwt</spanx>
	  is the default client authentication method to federation endpoints
	  when client authentication is supported.
	  This client authentication method is described in Section 9 of
	  <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>.
	  The client authentication JWT MUST be signed with a Federation Entity Key.
	  The audience of the JWT MUST be the URL of the federation endpoint.
	  When client authentication is used,
	  the request MUST be an HTTP request using the POST method,
	  with the client authentication and endpoint request parameters passed in the POST body.
	  Federations can choose to also use other client authentication methods.

	<section title="Client Authentication Metadata for Federation Endpoints"

	    Like other OAuth and OpenID endpoints supporting client authentication,

      <t>
        An Entity (Party A) that wants to establish trust with
        another Entity (Party B) MUST have Party B's Entity Identifier and a list of
        Entity Identifiers of Trust Anchors and their public signing keys.
        Party A will first have to fetch
        sufficient Entity Statements to establish at least one chain of trust
        from Party B to one or more of the Trust Anchors.
        After that, Party A MUST validate the Trust Chains independently,
        and if there are multiple valid Trust Chains and if the
        application demands it, choose one to use.
      </t>

      <section anchor="fetching-es"
               title="Fetching Entity Statements to Establish a Trust Chain">
        <t>
          Depending on the circumstances, Party A MAY be
          handed Party B's Entity Configuration, or it may
          have to fetch it by itself. If it needs to fetch it, it will use the
          process described in <xref target="federation_configuration"/>
          based on the Entity Identifier of Party B.
        </t>
        <t>
          The next step is to iterate through the list of
          Intermediates listed in
          <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>, ignoring the authority
          hints that end in an unknown Trust Anchor,
          requesting an Entity Configuration from each of the Intermediates.
          If the received Entity Configuration contains an authority hint, this
          process is repeated.
        </t>
        <t>
          With the list of all Intermediates and the Trust Anchor, the respective
          fetch endpoints, as defined in <xref target="fetch_endpoint"/>, are used to fetch
          Entity Statements about the Intermediates and Party B.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note: Federation participants SHOULD NOT attempt to fetch
          Entity Statements they already have obtained during this
          process to prevent loops.
        </t>
        <t>
          A successful operation will return one or more lists of
          Entity Statements. Each of the lists terminating in a self-signed
          Entity Statement is issued by a Trust Anchor.
        </t>
        <t>
          If there is no path from Party B to at least one of the
          trusted Trust Anchors, then the list will be empty and there is no
          way of establishing trust in Party B's information.
          How Party A deals with this is out of scope for this specification.

      <section title="Validating a Trust Chain" anchor="trust_chain_validation">
        <t>
          As described in <xref target="trust_chain"/>,
          a Trust Chain consists of an ordered list of Entity Statements.
          So however Party A has acquired the set of
          Entity Statements, it MUST now verify that it is a proper Trust Chain
          using the rules laid out in that section.
        </t>
        <t>
	  Let us refer to the Entity Statements in the Trust Chain as
	  ES[j], where j = 0,...,i,
	  with 0 being the index of the first Entity Statement
	  and i being the zero-based index of the last.
	  To validate the Trust Chain, the following MUST be done:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              For each Entity Statement ES[j], where j = 0,..,i:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  Verify that the statement contains all the required claims.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Verify that <spanx style="verb">iat</spanx> has a value in the
                  past.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Verify that <spanx style="verb">exp</spanx> has a value that
                  is in the future.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              For ES[0] (the Entity Configuration of the Trust Chain subject), verify that
	      <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> == <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>.
            </t>
            <t>
              For ES[0], verify that its signature validates with a public key
	      in ES[0]["jwks"].
            </t>
            <t>
              For each j = 0,...,i-1, verify that ES[j]["iss"] == ES[j+1]["sub"].
            </t>
            <t>
              For each j = 0,...,i-1, verify the signature of ES[j] with a public
              key in ES[j+1]["jwks"].
            </t>
            <t>
              For ES[i] (the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration), verify that
	      the issuer matches the Entity Identifier of the Trust Anchor.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      For ES[i], verify that
	      its signature validates with a public key of the Trust Anchor.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Verifying the signature is a much more expensive
          operation than verifying the correctness of the statement and the
          timestamps. An implementer MAY therefore choose not to verify the
          signatures until all the other checks have been done.
        </t>
        <t>
	  Federation participants MAY cache Entity Statements and signature verification
          results until they expire, per
          <xref target="trust_lifetime"/>.

      <section anchor="choosing-chain" title="Choosing One of the Valid Trust Chains">
        <t>
          If multiple valid Trust Chains are found, Party A will
          need to decide on which one to use.
	  One simple rule would be to prefer a shorter chain over a longer one.
	  Federation participants MAY follow other rules according to local policy.

               title="Calculating the Expiration Time of a Trust Chain">
        <t>
          Each Entity Statement in a Trust Chain is signed and MUST have an
          expiration time (<spanx style="verb">exp</spanx>).
          The expiration time of the whole Trust Chain is the minimum
          (<spanx style="verb">exp</spanx>) value within the Trust Chain.

        <t>
          If the federation topology is being updated, for example when a set
          of Leaf Entities is moved to a new Intermediate Entity, the Trust Chain
          validation may fail in a transient manner. Retrying after a period of
          time may resolve the situation.

	  Note that an alternative method for resolving a Trust Chain
	  for an Entity (Party B) using the methods described above
	  is to use a resolve endpoint, as described in <xref target="resolve"/>.
	  This lets the resolver do the work that otherwise the Entity (Party A)
	  wanting to establish trust would have to do for itself.

        This specification facilitates smoothly updating metadata
        and public keys.
      </t>
      <t>
        As described in <xref target="trust_lifetime"/>,
        each Trust Chain has an expiration time.
        Federation participants MUST support
        refreshing a Trust Chain when it expires.
        How often a participant reevaluates the Trust Chain depends on
        how quickly it wants to find out that something has changed.

      <section anchor="key-rollover" title="Protocol Key Rollover">
        <t>
          If a Leaf Entity publishes its public keys in its metadata
          using <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx>, the expiration time of
          its Entity Configuration
	  can be used to control how often the receiving Entity
          needs to fetch an updated set of public keys.

      <section title="Key Rollover for a Trust Anchor"
               anchor="key_rollover_anchor">
        <t>
          A Trust Anchor MUST publish an Entity Configuration about
          itself. The Trust Anchor SHOULD set an expiration
          time on its Entity Configuration,
	  such that federation participants will re-fetch it at reasonable intervals.
	  When a Trust Anchor rolls over its signing keys, it needs to:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              Add the new keys to the <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> representing
              the Trust Anchor's signing keys in its Entity Configuration.
            </t>
            <t>
              Keep signing the Entity Configuration and the Entity Statements using
              the old keys for a long enough time period to allow all
              Subordinates to have obtained the new keys.
            </t>
            <t>
              Switch to signing with the new keys.
            </t>
            <t>
              After a reasonable time period, remove the old keys. What is
              regarded as a reasonable time is dependent on the security profile
              and risk assessment of the Trust Anchor.

      <section title="Redundant Retrieval of Trust Anchor Keys" anchor="TrustAnchorKeys">
        <t>
          It is RECOMMENDED that Federation Operators provide a means of retrieving the public keys
          for the Trust Anchors it administers that is independent of those Trust Anchors' Entity Configurations.
          This is intended to provide redundancy in the eventuality of the compromise of
          the Web PKI infrastructure underlying retrieval of public keys from Entity Configurations.
        </t>
        <t>
          The keys retrieved via the independent mechanism specified by the Federation Operator
          SHOULD be compared to those retrieved via the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration.
          If they do not match, both SHOULD be retrieved again.
          If they still do not match, it is indicative of a security or configuration problem.
          The appropriate remediation steps in that eventuality SHOULD be specified by the Federation Operator.

      </section>

      <section anchor="revocation" title="Revocation">
        <t>
          Since the participants in federations are expected to check the Trust Chain on a regular
          frequent basis, this specification does not define a
          revocation process. Specific federations MAY make a
          different choice and will then have to define their own revocation process.

    <section title="OpenID Connect Client Registration" anchor="client_registration">
      <t>
        This section describes how the mechanisms defined in this specification
        are used to establish trust between an RP and an OP
        that have no explicit configuration or registration between them in advance.
      </t>
      <t>
        There are two alternative approaches to establish trust between an
        RP and an OP, which we call Automatic Registration and Explicit Registration.
        Members of a federation or a community
        SHOULD agree upon which one to use. While implementations should
        support both methods, deployments MAY choose to use one or the other of them.
      </t>
      <t>
        Independent of whether the RP uses Automatic or Explicit Registration,
        the way that the RP learns about the OP is the same:
        It uses the procedure
        described in <xref target="resolving_trust"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	Note that both Automatic Registration and Explicit Registration
	can also be used for OAuth 2.0 profiles other than OpenID Connect.
	To do so, rather than using the Entity Type Identifiers
	<spanx style="verb">openid_relying_party</spanx> and
	<spanx style="verb">openid_provider</spanx>,
	one would instead use the Entity Type Identifiers
	<spanx style="verb">oauth_client</spanx> and
	<spanx style="verb">oauth_authorization_server</spanx>,
	or possibly other Entity Type Identifiers defined for the specific
	OAuth 2.0 profile being used.
      </t>

      <section title="Automatic Registration" anchor="automatic">
        <t>
          Automatic Registration enables an RP to make Authentication Requests
          without a prior registration step with the OP.
          The OP resolves the RP's Entity Configuration from the Client ID in the Authentication Request,
          following the process defined in <xref target="resolving_trust"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Automatic Registration has the following characteristics:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              In all interactions with the OP, the RP employs its Entity Identifier as the Client ID.
              The OP retrieves the RP's Entity Configuration
              from the URL derived from the Entity Identifier, as
              described in <xref target="federation_configuration"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
              Since there is no registration step prior to the Authentication Request,
              the RP MUST NOT be supplied with a Client Secret.
              Instead, the Automatic Registration model requires the RP to use
              asymmetric cryptography to authenticate its requests.
            </t>
            <t>
              The OP MUST publish that it supports one or more request authentication
              methods using the <spanx style="verb">openid_provider</spanx> metadata parameter
              <spanx style="verb">request_authentication_methods_supported</spanx>.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          An OP that supports Automatic Registration MUST include the

          <spanx style="verb">client_registration_types_supported</spanx>
          metadata parameter.

              <t>
                When the OP receives an incoming Authentication Request,
                the OP supports OpenID Federation, the incoming
                Client ID
                is a valid URL, and the OP does not have the Client ID
                registered as a known
                client, then the OP SHOULD resolve the Trust Chains
                related to the requestor.
              </t>
              <t>
                An RP MAY present a Trust Chain related to itself to the OP in the Request Object using the
                <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> request parameter
		        defined in <xref target="trust_chain_param"/>.
                If the OP does not have a valid registration for the RP or
                its registration has expired, the OP MAY use the received
                Trust Chain as a hint for which path to take from the
                RP's Entity to the Trust Anchor.
                The OP MAY evaluate the statements in the
                <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx>
                to make its Federation Entity Discovery procedure more efficient,
                especially if the RP contains multiple authority hints in
                its Entity Configuration.
	      </t>
	      <t>
                If the OP already has a valid registration for the RP, it MAY
                use the received Trust Chain to update the RP's registration.
                Whenever the OP uses a Trust Chain submitted by an RP, the
                OP MUST fully verify it, including every Entity Statement contained in it.
                A Trust Chain may be relied upon by the OP because it has validated
                all of its statements. This is true whether these statements
                are retrieved from their URLs or whether they
                are provided via the <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx>
                request parameter in the Request Object.
              </t>
              <t>
                If the RP does not include the
                <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx>
                request parameter in the Request Object,
                or the OP does not support this feature, it then MUST
                validate the possible Trust Chains, starting with the RP's Entity Configuration,
                as described in <xref target="fetching-es"/>,
                and resolve the RP metadata with Entity Type
                <spanx style="verb">openid_relying_party</spanx>.
              </t>
              <t>
                The OP SHOULD furthermore verify that the resolved metadata of the RP
                complies with the client metadata specification
                <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>.
              </t>
              <t>
                Once the OP has the RP's metadata, it MUST verify that the client
                was actually the one sending the Authentication Request by
                verifying the signature of the Request Object using the key
                material the client published in its metadata for the
                <spanx style="verb">openid_relying_party</spanx> Entity Type.
		If the signature does not verify, the OP MUST reject the request.

		  as described in Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC8705"/>.
                  In this case, the self-signed certificate MUST be present as
                  the value of an <spanx style="verb">x5c</spanx>

                  the RP's keys.
                </t>
                <t>

              Note that if mTLS is used, TLS client authentication MUST be

            employed for use cases beyond OpenID Federation.
            For instance, ecosystems using <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect</xref>,
            <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref>, and
            <xref target="FAPI">FAPI</xref> can utilize Automatic Registration.

        <t>
          Using this method, the RP establishes its client registration with the
          OP by means of a dedicated registration request, similar to
          <xref target="OpenID.Registration"/>, but instead of its metadata, the
          RP submits its Entity Configuration or an entire Trust Chain. When
          the Explicit Registration is completed, the RP can proceed to
          make regular OpenID authentication requests to the OP.
        </t>

        <t>
          An OP that supports Explicit Registration MUST include the
          <spanx style="verb">explicit</spanx> keyword in its
          <spanx style="verb">client_registration_types_supported</spanx>
          metadata parameter and set the
          <spanx style="verb">federation_registration_endpoint</spanx> metadata
          parameter to the URL at which it receives Explicit Registration requests.
        </t>

        <t>
          Explicit Registration is suitable for implementation on top of the
          <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client
          Registration 1.0</xref> endpoint of an OP deployment. In contrast to
          Automatic Registration, it enables an OP to provision a Client ID, a
          Client Secret, and metadata parameters.
        </t>

        <t>An example of an Explicit Registration is provided in
          <xref target="ExplicitRegExample"/>.

          <section anchor="Cliregreq" title="Explicit Client Registration Request">
            <t>
              The RP performs Explicit Client Registration as follows:
            </t>
            <t>
              <list style="numbers">

                <t>
                  Once the RP has determined a set of Trust Anchors it has in common with the OP,
                  it chooses the subset it wants to proceed with. This
                  may be a single Trust Anchor, or it can also be more than one.
                  The RP MUST perform Trust Chain and metadata resolution for
                  the OP, as specified in <xref target="resolving_trust"/>. If
                  the resolution is not successful, the RP MUST abort the
                  request.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Using this subset of Trust Anchors, the RP chooses a set of
                  <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
                  from the hints that are available to it. Each hint MUST,
                  when used as a starting point for Trust Chain collection,
                  lead to at least one of the Trust Anchors in the subset.
                  If the RP has more than one Trust Anchor in common with the
                  OP it MUST select a subset of Trust Anchors to proceed with.
                  The subset may be as small as a single Trust Anchor, or
                  include multiple ones.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The RP will then construct its Entity Configuration,
                  where the metadata statement chosen is influenced by the OP's
                  metadata and where the
                  <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
                  included are picked by the process described above.
                  From its Immediate Superiors, the RP MUST select
                  one or more <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx> so
                  that every hint, when used as the starting point for a Trust Chain
                  collection, leads to at least one of the Trust Anchors
                  in the subset selected above.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The RP MAY include its Entity Configuration
                  in a Trust Chain regarding itself.
                  In that case, the Registration Request will contain an
                  array with the sequence of
                  Entity Statements that compose the Trust Chain
                  between the RP that is making the request and the
                  selected Trust Anchor.
                  The RP MUST include its
                  metadata in its Entity Configuration and use the
                  <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx> selected above.
                  <vspace blankLine="1"/>

                  The RP SHOULD select its metadata parameters to comply with
                  the resolved OP metadata and thus ensure a successful
                  registration with the OP. Note that if the submitted RP
                  metadata is not compliant with the metadata of the OP, the
                  OP may choose to modify it to make it compliant
                  rather than reject the request with an error response.
                </t>

                <t>
                  The Entity Configuration, or the entire Trust Chain,
                  is sent, using HTTP POST, to the
                  <spanx style="verb">federation_registration_endpoint</spanx>.
                  The Entity Configuration or Trust Chain is the entire POST body.
                  The RP MUST sign its Entity Configuration with a current
                  Federation Entity Key in its possession.

                  when it contains only the Entity Configuration of the

                  <spanx style="verb">application/trust-chain+json</spanx>.
                  The RP MAY include its Entity Configuration in a Trust Chain
                  that leads to the RP. In this case, the registration request
                  will contain an array consisting of the sequence of
                  statements that make up the Trust Chain between the RP and
                  the Trust Anchor the RP selected.

                The OP processes the request as follows:

              <t>
                <list style="numbers">
                  <t>
                    Upon receiving a registration request, the OP MUST inspect
                    the content type to determine whether it contains an Entity Configuration
                    or an entire Trust Chain.
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    If the request contains an Entity Configuration the OP
                    MUST use it to complete the Federation Entity Discovery by
                    collecting and evaluating the Trust Chains that start with
                    the <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx> in the
                    Entity Configuration of the RP. After validating at least
                    one Trust Chain, the OP MUST verify the signature of the
                    received Entity Configuration. If the OP finds more than
                    one acceptable Trust Chain, it MUST choose one Trust Anchor
                    from those chains as the one to proceed with.
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    If the request contains a Trust Chain, the OP MAY evaluate
                    the statements in the Trust Chain to save the HTTP calls
                    that are necessary to perform the Federation Entity Discovery,
                    especially if the RP included more than one
                    authority hint in its Entity Configuration. Otherwise, the
                    OP MUST extract the RP Entity Configuration from the Trust Chain
                    and proceed according to Step 2,
		    as if only an Entity Configuration was received.
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    At this point, if the OP finds that it already has an
                    existing client registration for the requesting RP, then
                    that registration MUST be invalidated. The precise time of
                    the invalidation is at the OP's discretion, as the OP may
                    want to ensure the completion of concurrent OpenID
                    authentication requests initiated by the RP while the
                    registration request is being processed.

                    The OP MAY retain client credentials and key material from
                    the invalidated registration in order to verify past RP
                    signatures and perform other cryptographic operations on
                    past RP data.

                  <t>
                    The OP will now use the RP metadata to create a client
                    registration compliant with its own OP metadata and other
                    applicable policies.
                    <vspace blankLine="1"/>

                    The OP MAY provision the RP with a

                    Entity Identifier. This enables Explicit Registration to be
                    implemented on top of the
                    <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic

                    <spanx style="verb">registration_client_uri</spanx>
                    because the expected way for the RP to update its
                    registration is to make a new Explicit Registration
                    request. If the RP is provisioned with a
                    <spanx style="verb">registration_access_token</spanx> for
                    some purpose, for example to let it independently check its
                    registered metadata, the token MUST NOT allow modification

                    <vspace blankLine="1"/>

                    The OP MAY modify the received RP metadata, for example by

                    to make it compliant with its own OP metadata and other
                    policies. If the OP does not accept the RP metadata or is
                    unwilling to modify it to make it compliant, it
                    MUST return a client registration error response, with an

            An RP can utilize the <spanx style="verb">exp</spanx> claim of the

            renewing its client registration. RP implementers should note that
            if the OP expiration of the <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx>
            coincides with an OAuth 2.0 flow that was just initiated by the RP, this
            may cause OpenID Connect authentication requests, token requests, or
            UserInfo requests to suddenly fail. Renewing the RP registration
            prior to its expiration can prevent such errors from
            occurring and ensure the end-user experience is not disrupted.
          </t>
          <t>
            An OP MAY invalidate a client registration before the expiration
            that is indicated in the registration Entity Statement for the RP.
            An example reason could be the OP leaving the federation that was
            used to register the RP.

      <section title="Registration Validity and Trust Reevaluation" anchor="client_reg_trust_re_eval">
        <t>
          The validity of an Automatic or Explicit Registration at an OP MUST
          NOT exceed the lifetime of the Trust Chain the OP used to create the
          registration. An OP MAY choose to expire the registration at some
          earlier time, or choose to perform additional periodic reevaluations
          of the Trust Chain for the registered RP before the Trust Chain
          reaches its expiration time.
        </t>
        <t>
          Similarly, an RP that obtained an Automatic or Explicit Registration
          MUST NOT use it past the expiration of the Trust Chain the RP used to
          establish trust in the OP. For an RP using Automatic Registration, the
          trust in the OP MUST be successfully reevaluated before continuing to
          make requests to the OP. For an RP using Explicit Registration, the RP
          MUST successfully renew its registration. An RP MAY choose to perform
          additional periodic reevaluations of the Trust Chain for the OP
          before the Trust Chain reaches its expiration time.

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              With Automatic Registration, there is no registration step prior to the Authentication Request,
              whereas with Explicit Registration, there is.
              (<xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>
              and <xref target="RFC7591">OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration</xref>
              also employ a prior registration step.)
            </t>
            <t>
              With Automatic Registration, the Client ID value is the RP's Entity Identifier
              and is supplied to the OP by the RP,
              whereas with Explicit Registration, a Client ID is assigned by the OP and supplied to the RP.
            </t>
            <t>
              Instead of using a Client Secret to authenticate the client, with Automatic Registration,
              the client is authenticated by means of the RP proving that it controls a private key
              corresponding to one of its Entity Configuration's public keys.
            </t>

      <section title="Rationale for the Trust Chain in the Request" anchor="TrustChainParamRationale">
        <t>
          Both Automatic and Explicit Client Registration support
          the submission of the Trust Chain embedded in the Request,
          calculated by the requestor, and related to itself.

          This provides the following benefits:
          <list style="symbols">

          <t>
            It solves the problem of OPs using RP metadata that has become stale.
            This stale data may occur when the OP uses cached RP metadata from a Trust Chain
            that has not reached its expiration time yet.
            The RP MAY notify the OP that a change has taken place by including
            the <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> header parameter
            or the <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> request parameter
	    in the request,
            thus letting the OP update its Client Registration
	    and preventing potential temporary faults due to stale metadata.
          </t>

          <t>
            It enables the RP to pass a verifiable hint for which trust path to
            take to build the Trust Chain. This can reduce the costs
            of RP Federation Entity Discovery for OPs in complex federations where the
            RP has multiple Trust Anchors or the Trust Chain resolution may
            result in dead-ends.
          </t>

          <t>
            It enables direct passing of the Entity Configuration, including
            any present Trust Marks, thus saving the OP from having to make
            an HTTP request to the RP

      <section title="Denial-of-Service Attack Prevention" anchor="DoS">
        <t>
          Some of the interfaces defined in this specification could be used for
          Denial-of-Service attacks (DoS), most notably, the resolve endpoint
          (<xref target="entity_listing"/>), Explicit Client Registration
          (<xref target="explicit"/>), and
          Automatic Client Registration (<xref target="automatic"/>) can
          be exploited as vectors of HTTP propagation attacks.
          Below is an explanation of how such an attack can occur and
          the countermeasures to prevent it.
        </t>
        <t>
          An adversary, providing hundreds of fake
          <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
          in its Entity Configuration,
          could exploit the Federation Entity Discovery mechanism
          to propagate many HTTP requests.
          Imagine an adversary controlling an RP that sends an authorization
          request to an OP. For each request crafted
          by the adversary, the OP produces one request for
          the adversary's Entity Configuration and another one
          for each URL found in the <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>.
        </t>
        <t>
          If these endpoints are provided, some adequate defense methods are required,
          such as those described below and in
          <xref target="RFC4732"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Implementations should set a limit on the number of
          <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
          they are willing to inspect. This is to protect against attacks
          where an adversary might define a large count of false
          <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
          in their Entity Configuration.
        </t>
        <t>
          Entities may be required to include a
          <xref target="trust_chain_head_param">Trust Chain</xref>
          in their requests, as explained in <xref target="UsingAuthzRequestObject"/>.
          The static Trust Chain gives a predefined trust path,
          meaning that Federation Entity Discovery need not be performed.
          In this case, the propagation attacks will
          be prevented since the Trust Chain can be statically validated with
          a public key of the Trust Anchor.
        </t>
        <t>
          A Trust Mark can be statically validated using the public key of its issuer.
          The static validation of the Trust Marks represents a
          filter against propagation attacks.
          If the OpenID Provider (OP) discovers at least one valid Trust Mark
          within an Entity Configuration, this may serve as evidence of
          the reliability of the Relying Party that initiated the request.
          Given that the Trust Mark is optional, the decision to require
          one is at the discretion of the federation implementation,
          where a federation may define and require Trust Marks
          according to specific needs.
        </t>
        <t>
          If Client authentication is not required at the resolve endpoint,
          then incoming requests should not automatically trigger the collection
          (Federation Entity Discovery process) and assessment of Trust Chains.
          Instead, the resolve endpoint should only respond to unauthenticated
          Client requests with cached information about Entities that have
          already been evaluated and deemed trustworthy. The initiation of
          the Federation Entity Discovery process should not be the default
          action for the resolve endpoint in this case.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Unsigned Error Messages" anchor="UnsignedError">
        <t>
          One of the fundamental design goals of this protocol is to
          protect messages end-to-end. This cannot be accomplished by demanding
          TLS since TLS, in lots of cases, is not end-to-end but ends in a HTTPS
          to HTTP Reverse Proxy.
          Allowing unsigned error messages therefore opens an attack
          vector for someone who wants to run a Denial-of-Service attack.
          This is not specific to OpenID Federation but equally valid for
          other protocols when HTTPS to HTTP reverse proxies are used.

        Let us assume the following: The project LIGO would like to offer access
        to its wiki to all OPs in eduGAIN. LIGO is registered with the InCommon
        federation.
      </t>

      <figure>

      </figure>
      <t>
        Both SWAMID and InCommon are identity federations in their own right.
        They also have in common that they are both members of
        the eduGAIN federation.
      </t>
      <t>
        SWAMID and InCommon are different in how they register Entities.
        SWAMID registers organizations and lets the organizations register
        Entities that belong to the organization, while InCommon registers all
        Entities directly and not beneath any organization Entity.
        Hence the differences in depth in the federations.
      </t>
      <t>
        Let us assume a researcher from Umeå University would like to
        login to
        the LIGO Wiki. At the Wiki, the researcher will use some kind of
        discovery service to find the home identity provider (op.umu.se).
      </t>
      <t>
        Once the RP part of the Wiki knows which OP it SHOULD talk to, it has
        to find out a few things about the OP. All those things
        can be found in the metadata. But finding the metadata is not enough;
        the RP also has to trust the metadata.
      </t>
      <t>
        Let us make a detour and start with what it takes to build a federation.
      </t>

      <section title="Setting Up a Federation" anchor="federation_intro">
        <t>
          These are the steps to set up a federation infrastructure:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Generation of Trust Anchor signing keys. These MUST be public/private key pairs.
            </t>
            <t>
              Set up a signing service that can sign JWTs/Entity Statements
              using the Federation Entity Keys.
            </t>
            <t>
              Set up web services that can publish signed Entity Statements,
              one for the URL corresponding to the federation's Entity Identifier returning
              an Entity Configuration and the other one providing the fetch endpoint,
	      as described in <xref target="fetch_statement"/>.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Once these requirements have been satisfied, a Federation Operator
          can add Entities to the federation.
          Adding an Entity comes down to:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Providing the Entity with the
              federation's Entity Identifier and the public part of the key pairs used
              by the federation operator for signing Entity Statements.
            </t>
            <t>
              Getting the Entity's Entity Identifier and the JWK Set that the Entity
              plans to publish in its Entity Configuration.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Before the federation operator starts adding Entities, there must
          be policies on who can be part of the federation and the
          layout of the federation. Is it supposed to be a one-layer federation
          like InCommon, a two-layer one like the SWAMID federation,
          or a multi-layer federation?
          The federation may also want to consider implementing other
          policies using the federation policy framework,
          as described in <xref target="federation_policy"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          With the federation in place, things can start happening.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="The LIGO Wiki Discovers the OP's Metadata"
               anchor="op_discovery">
        <t>
          Federation Entity Discovery is a sequence of steps that starts with the RP
          fetching the Entity Configuration of the OP's Entity (in this case,
          https://op.umu.se) using the process defined in
          <xref target="federation_configuration"/>.
          What follows after that is this sequence of steps:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
	      Pick out the Immediate Superior Entities using the authority hints.
            </t>
            <t>
              Fetch the Entity Configuration for each such Entity. This uses the
              process defined in
              <xref target="federation_configuration"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
              Use the fetch endpoint of each Immediate Superior to
              obtain Subordinate Statements about the Immediate Subordinate Entity,
              per <xref target="fetch_statement"/>.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          How many times this has to be repeated depends on the depth of the
          federation. What follows below is the result of each step the RP
          has to take to find the OP's metadata using the federation setup
          described above.
        </t>
        <t>
          When building the Trust Chain, the Subordinate Statements issued
          by each Immediate Superior about their Immediate Subordinates are used together with the
          Entity Configuration of the Trust Chain subject.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Entity Configurations of Intermediates are not
          part of the Trust Chain.
        </t>

          <t>The LIGO WIKI RP fetches the Entity Configuration from the

            The OP receives the RP's Entity Configuration and proceeds with the
            sequence of steps laid out in <xref target="op_discovery"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The OP successfully resolves the same RP metadata described in
            <xref target="rp_metadata_eval"/>. It then registers the RP in
            compliance with its own OP metadata and returns the result in a
            registration Entity Statement.
          </t>
          <t>
            Assuming the OP does not support refresh tokens it will register
            the RP for the <spanx style="verb">authorization_code</spanx> grant
            type only. This is reflected in the metadata returned to the RP.
          </t>
          <t>The returned metadata also includes the
            <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx>, the
            <spanx style="verb">client_secret</spanx> and other parameters that
            the OP provisioned for the RP.
