    <abstract>
      <t>
        A federation can be expressed as an agreement between parties that trust each other.
        In bilateral federations, direct trust can be established between
        two organizations belonging to the same federation.
        In a multilateral federation, bilateral agreements might not be practical,
        in which case, trust can be mediated by a third party.
        That is the model used in this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        An Entity in the federation must be able to trust that other Entities
        it interacts with belong to the same federation.
        It must also be able to trust that the information the other Entities
        publish about themselves has not been tampered with during transport
        and that it adheres to the federation's policies.
          </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines basic components to build multilateral
        federations. It also defines how to apply them in the contexts of OpenID
        Connect and OAuth 2.0. These components can be used by other application
        protocols for the purpose of establishing trust.
      </t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This specification describes how two Entities that would like to
        interact can establish trust between them by means of a trusted third party
        called a Trust Anchor.
        A Trust Anchor is an Entity whose main purpose is to issue statements
        about Entities.
        An identity federation can be realized using this specification using
        one or more levels of authorities.
        Examples of authorities are federation operators, organizations,
        departments within organizations, and individual sites.
        This
        specification provides the basic technical trust infrastructure building
        blocks needed to create a dynamic and distributed trust network, such as a
        federation.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that this specification only concerns itself with how Entities
        in a federation get to know about each other. An organization MAY
        be represented by more than one Entity in a federation. An Entity
        MAY also belong to more than one federation. Determining that two
        Entities belong to the same federation is the basis for
        establishing trust between them in this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        Of course, the word "trust" is also used in the vernacular to
        encompass confidence in the security, reliability, and integrity of entities
        and their actions. This kind trust is often established through
        empirical proof, such as past performance, security certifications,
        or transparent operational practices, which demonstrate a track
        record of adherence to security standards and ethical conduct.
        To be clear, this broader meaning of trust, while important,
        is largely beyond the scope of what this specification accomplishes.
      </t>

	  Below is an example of two federations rooted at two different
	  Trust Anchors with some members in common.
	  Every Entity is able to establish mutual trust with any
	  other Entity by means of having at least one
	  common Trust Anchor between them.
	  These abbreviations are used in the diagram:
	  OpenID Provider (OP),
	  Relying Party (RP),

      <t>
        The basic component is the Entity Statement, which is a cryptographically
        signed <xref target="RFC7519">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>.
        A set of Entity Statements can form a path from an Entity
	(typically a Leaf Entity) to
        a Trust Anchor. Entity Configurations
        issued by Entities about themselves control the Trust Chain
        resolution process.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Entity Configuration of a Leaf or Intermediate Entity contains one or more
        references to its Immediate Superiors in the
	<spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx> parameter
	described in <xref target="authority_hints"/>.
        These references can be used to download the Entity Configuration of each Immediate Superior.
        One or more Entity Configurations are traversed during the Federation Entity Discovery
        until the Trust Anchor is reached.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Trust Anchor and its Intermediates issue Entity Statements
        about their Immediate Subordinate Entities called Subordinate Statements.
	The sequence of Entity Configurations
        and Subordinate Statements that validate the relationship between
        a Superior and a Subordinate, along a path towards the Trust Anchor,
        forms the proof that the subject of Trust Chain
	(typically a Leaf Entity) is a member of
        the federation rooted at the Trust Anchor.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Trust Chain that links the Entity Configurations to one another
	is verified with the signature of each Entity Configuration,
	as described in <xref target="trust_chain"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Once there is a verified Trust Chain, the federation policy is applied
        and the metadata for the Trust Chain subject
	within the Federation is derived,
        as described in <xref target="federation_policy"/>.

        This specification deals with trust operations;
        it does not cover or touch protocol operations
        other than metadata derivation and exchange.
        In OpenID Connect terms, these are the protocol operations specified in
        <xref target="OpenID.Discovery">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</xref>
        and
        <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
        OpenID Connect constructs are used in many of the examples in this
        specification, however this does not mean that this specification can only be used
        with OpenID Connect. On the contrary, it can also be
        used to build federations for other protocols.

      <section title="Cryptographic Trust Mechanism" anchor="CryptographicTrustMechanism">
	<t>
	  The objects defined by this specification
	  that are used to establish cryptographic trust between participants
	  are secured as signed JWTs using public key cryptography.
	  In particular, the keys used for securing these objects are managed by
	  the Entities controlling those objects, with the public keys securing them
	  being distributed through those objects themselves.
	  This kind of trust mechanism has been utilized by
	  research and academic federations for over a decade.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Note that this cryptographic trust mechanism intentionally does not rely on
	  Web PKI / TLS <xref target="RFC9525"/> certificates for signing keys.
	  Which TLS certificates are considered trusted can vary considerably between systems
	  depending upon which certificate authorities are considered trusted
	  and there have been notable examples of ostensibly trusted certificates being compromised.
	  For those reasons, this specification explicitly eschews reliance on Web PKI
	  in favor of self-managed public keys, in this case,
	  keys represented as JSON Web Keys (JWKs) <xref target="RFC7517"/>.

      <section anchor="entity-statement" title="Entity Statement">
        <t>
          An Entity Statement contains the information needed for the Entity
          that is the subject of the Entity Statement to participate in federation(s).
          An Entity Statement is a signed JWT.
          The subject of the JWT is the Entity itself.
          The issuer of the JWT is the party that issued the Entity Statement.
          All Entities in a federation publish an Entity Statement about themselves
          called an Entity Configuration.
          Superior Entities in a federation publish Entity Statements about
          their Immediate Subordinate Entities called Subordinate Statements.
        </t>
        <t>
          Entity Statement JWTs MUST be explicitly typed, by setting the
          <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> header parameter to
          <spanx style="verb">entity-statement+jwt</spanx> to prevent
          cross-JWT confusion, per Section 3.11 of <xref target="RFC8725"/>.
          Entity Statements without a <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> header parameter
          or with a different <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> value MUST be rejected.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Entity Statement is signed using one of the private keys of the issuer
          Entity in the form of a <xref target="RFC7515">JSON Web Signature
          (JWS)</xref>.
          Implementations SHOULD support signature verification with
          the RSA SHA-256 algorithm because OpenID Connect Core
          requires support for it (<spanx style="verb">alg</spanx>
          value of <spanx style="verb">RS256</spanx>).
          Federations MAY also specify different mandatory-to-implement algorithms.
          Note that a Trust Chain can contain Entity Statements signed using different
          signing algorithms, as long as each signature uses a signature algorithm
          supported by the trust framework and implementations in use.
        </t>
	<t>
	  Entity Statement JWTs MUST include the
	  <spanx style="verb">kid</spanx> (Key ID) header parameter
	  with its value being the Key ID of the signing key used.

          Entities whose statements build a Trust Chain are categorized as:
          <list style="hanging">

              <vspace/>

        </t>
        <t>
          A Trust Chain begins with an Entity Configuration
	  that is the subject of the Trust Chain,
	  which is typically a Leaf Entity.
          The Trust Chain has zero or more Subordinate Statements
          issued by Intermediates about their Immediate Subordinates,
          and includes the Subordinate Statement issued by the
          Trust Anchor about the top-most Intermediate
          (if there are Intermediates) or the Trust Chain subject
          (if there are no Intermediates).
          The Trust Chain logically always ends with the
          Entity Configuration of the Trust Anchor,
	  even though it MAY be omitted from
	  the JSON array representing the Trust Chain in some cases.
        </t>
        <t>
	  The Trust Chain contains the configuration of the federation
	  as it applies to the Trust Chain subject
          at the time of the evaluation of the chain.
        </t>
        <t>
          A simple example: If we have an RP that belongs to Organization A
          that is a member of Federation F, the Trust Chain for such a setup
          will contain the following Entity Statements:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              an Entity Configuration about the RP published by itself,
            </t>
            <t>
              a Subordinate Statement about the RP published by Organization A,
            </t>
            <t>
              a Subordinate Statement about Organization A published by the Trust Anchor for F,
            </t>
	    <t>
	      an Entity Configuration about the Trust Anchor for F published by itself.
	    </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
	  Let us refer to the Entity Statements in the Trust Chain as
	  ES[j], where j = 0,...,i,
	  with 0 being the index of the first Entity Statement
	  and i being the zero-based index of the last.
	  Then:
          <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
	      ES[0] (the Entity Configuration of the Trust Chain subject)
	      is signed using a key in ES[0]["jwks"].
	    </t>
            <t>
	      The <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> Claim in an Entity Statement
	      is equal to the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> Claim in the next.
	      Restating this symbolically,
	      for each j = 0,...,i-1,
	      ES[j]["iss"] == ES[j+1]["sub"].
            </t>
            <t>
	      An Entity Statement is signed using a key from
	      the <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> Claim in the next.
	      Restating this symbolically,
	      for each j = 0,...,i-1,
	      ES[j] is signed by a key in ES[j+1]["jwks"].
            </t>
	    <t>
	      ES[i] (the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration in the Trust Chain)
	      is signed using a key in ES[i]["jwks"].
	    </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
	  The Trust Anchor's public keys are used to verify the signatures on
	  ES[i] (the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration) and
	  ES[i-1] (the Trust Anchor's Subordinate Statement about its
	  Immediate Subordinate in the Trust Chain).
	  The Trust Anchor's public keys are distributed
	  to Entities that need to verify a
          Trust Chain in some secure out-of-band way not described in this
          document.
        </t>

	<section title="Beginning and Ending Trust Chains"
		 anchor="trust-chain-ends">
	  <t>
	    A Trust Chain begins with the Entity Configuration of an Entity
	    for which trust is being established.
	    This is the subject of the Trust Chain.
	    This Entity typically plays a protocol role,
	    such as being an OpenID Provider or OpenID Relying Party.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    While such Entities are typically Leaf Entities,
	    other topologies are possible.
	    For instance, an Entity might simultaneously be an OpenID Provider
	    and an Intermediate Entity, with OpenID Relying Parties
	    and/or other Intermediates being Subordinate to it.
	    This is a case in which the subject of a Trust Chain
	    would not be a Leaf Entity.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    A Trust Chain ends with the Entity Configuration of a Trust Anchor.
	    While Trust Anchors typically have no Superiors,
	    a Trust Anchor will have a Superior when the Trust Anchor
	    also acts as an Intermediate Entity in another federation.
	    This will be the case when there is a hierarchy of federations.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Thus, while it is typical for a Trust Chain to end with
	    a Trust Anchor with no Superiors,
	    there are situations in which the Trust Chain will end with
	    a Trust Anchor that nonetheless has Superior Entities.
	  </t>

            The following is an example of a Trust Chain consisting of
            a Leaf's Entity Configuration and Subordinate Statements issued
            by an Intermediate Entity and a Trust Anchor. It shows
            the relationship between the three Entities,
	    their Entity Configurations, and their Subordinate Statements.
	    The Subordinate Statements are obtained from the
            <spanx style="verb">federation_fetch_endpoint</spanx> of
            the subject's Immediate Superior. The URL of the
            <spanx style="verb">federation_fetch_endpoint</spanx> is
            discovered in the Immediate Superior's Entity Configuration.
            Note that the first member of the Trust Chain (the Leaf)
            is depicted at the bottom of the diagram and that the last
            member (the Trust Anchor) is depicted at the top.

         <t>
          The <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> JWS header parameter is a
          JSON array containing the sequence of Entity Statements
	  that comprise the Trust Chain between
	  an Entity and the selected Trust Anchor.
	  The Trust Chain typically begins with the Entity Configuration
	  of the subject of the JWT in which this header parameter occurs;
	  however, in some cases, the Trust Chain will begin with
	  the Entity Configuration of a different Entity,
	  such as the issuer, which is the case for
	  the Resolve Response defined in <xref target="resolve-response"/>.
          The issuer of the JWT SHOULD select a Trust Anchor
	  that the Entity at the beginning of the Trust Chain
	  has in common with the audience of the JWT.
	  Otherwise, the issuer is free to select the Trust Anchor to use.
	 </t>
	 <t>
          Most signed JWTs MAY include the
          <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> JWS header parameter,
          with a few exceptions.
          Entity Configurations and Subordinate Statements MUST NOT
          contain the <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> header parameter,
          as they are integral components of a Trust Chain.
          Use of this header parameter is OPTIONAL.
          </t>

	      It is RECOMMENDED that an Entity Configuration
	      use only one of
	      <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx>,
	      <spanx style="verb">jwks_uri</spanx>, and
	      <spanx style="verb">signed_jwks_uri</spanx> in its OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 metadata.
	      However, there may be circumstances in which it is desirable to use multiple
	      JWK Set representations, such as when an Entity is in multiple federations and the
	      federations have different policies about the JWK Set representation to be used.
	      Also note that some implementations might not understand
	      all these representations.  For instance, while
	      <spanx style="verb">jwks_uri</spanx> will certainly be understood
	      in OpenID Connect OP metadata,
	      <spanx style="verb">signed_jwks_uri</spanx> might not be understood
	      by all OpenID Connect implementations, and so
	      a JWK Set representation that is understood also needs to be present.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      When multiple JWK Set representations are used, the keys present in each
	      representation SHOULD be the same.  Even if they are not completely the
	      same at a given instant in time (which may be the case during key rollover operations),
	      implementations MUST make them consistent in a timely manner.

          Trust Anchors and Intermediate Entities MAY define policies that apply

        </t>
        <t>
          A federation may utilize metadata policies to achieve specific
          objectives. For example, in a federation of

          objective may be to ensure the metadata published by OpenID Providers
          and Relying Parties are interoperable with one another. Another

          Note that the <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx> is not

        <section title="Principles" anchor="metadata_policy_principles">
          <t>
            OpenID Federation enables the definition of metadata policies with
            the following properties:

            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Hierarchy">
                <vspace/>
                Once applied to a metadata parameter, a metadata policy cannot be
                repealed or made more permissive by Intermediate Entities that are
                subordinate in the Trust Chain.
                <vspace/>
                The hierarchy of policies is preserved in nested federations where
                a Trust Anchor in one federation acts as an Intermediate Entity in
                another federation.
              </t>

	      <t hangText="Equal Opportunity">
		<vspace/>
		All Superior Entities in a Trust Chain can contribute metadata policies
		on an equal basis, provided their contributions result in a combined
        metadata policy that is logically sound.
		For instance, any Intermediate can further restrict the metadata
		of its Subordinates relative to what its Superiors specified.
        An Intermediate that introduces a conflict among the metadata policies
        causes the Trust Chain to be deemed invalid.
	      </t>

              <t hangText="Specificity and Granularity">
                <vspace/>
                Just like metadata, a metadata policy is bound to a specific
                Entity Type. This ensures policies for different Entity Types are
                independent and isolated from one another.
                <vspace/>
                Policies are expressed at the level of individual metadata
                parameters. The policies for a given Entity Type metadata
                parameter are thus independent and isolated from those for other
                parameters.
                <vspace/>
                When a Trust Anchor or an Intermediate Entity defines a metadata
                policy for an Entity Type, it applies to the metadata of all
                Subordinate Entities of that type in the Trust Chain.
                <vspace/>
                Because the place to define a policy is the Subordinate Statement
                and every Entity Statement is issued for a specific subject, a
                federation authority can choose to define a common Entity Type
                metadata policy for all its Subordinates, or specific Entity Type
                metadata policies for specific Subordinates.
              </t>

              <t hangText="Operation">
                <vspace/>
                A policy operates by performing a check, a modification, or both
                on a given metadata parameter. This specification defines a set
                of standard operators, described in
                <xref target="standard_metadata_policy_operators"/>. A
                federation MAY specify and use additional operators, provided
                they comply with the principles laid out in this section and with
                <xref target="metadata_policy_operators"/> and

                The resolution and application of metadata policies is an integral
                part of the Trust Chain resolution process, as described in
                <xref target="resolving_trust"/>.

		Some JSON libraries may have issues comparing JSON objects.
		For this reason, support for applying metadata policy to
		metadata values that are JSON objects is mandatory only for the
		<spanx style="verb">essential</spanx>
		operator, which does not require comparison of values.
		It is OPTIONAL for the
		<spanx style="verb">add</spanx>,
		<spanx style="verb">one_of</spanx>,
		<spanx style="verb">subset_of</spanx>, and
		<spanx style="verb">superset_of</spanx>
		operators, which operate on JSON arrays
		and therefore require comparison of values.
		And it is OPTIONAL for the
		<spanx style="verb">value</spanx> and
		<spanx style="verb">default</spanx> operators,
		since merging values and defaults requires comparing
		the operators' values with existing ones.

              <t>
                The metadata policy for a Trust Chain is determined by the

                The resolution process MUST first gather the names of all policy

                <xref target="standard_metadata_policy_operators"/> that are
                declared as critical. This is done by checking each Subordinate

                <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy_crit</spanx> Claim,

              <t>
                The resolution process proceeds by iterating through the
                Subordinate Statements. The sequence of this iteration is
                crucial - it MUST begin with the Subordinate Statement issued by
                the most Superior Entity and end with the Subordinate Statement
                issued by the Immediate Superior of the Trust Chain subject.

                ensure the data structure is compliant and that every metadata
                parameter policy contains only allowed operator combinations, as
                described in <xref target="metadata_policy_operators"/>, and in
                accordance with the specifications of the operators. It MUST
                also be ensured that the <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx>
                contains no operators that cannot be understood and processed
                whose names are among the collected
                <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy_crit</spanx> values. An
                unsuccessful validation MUST produce a policy error.

              <t>
                At each iteration step, the Subordinate Statement MUST be checked
                for the presence of a <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx>
                Claim. The first encountered
                <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx> MUST be validated as
                described above, after which it becomes the current metadata
                policy.

                If the iteration yields a next subordinate
                <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx> Claim, it MUST be
                validated as described above, then merged into the current

                The TA specifies a <spanx style="verb">max_path_length</spanx>

                TA specifies a <spanx style="verb">max_path_length</spanx> of 2,
                I2 specifies a <spanx style="verb">max_path_length</spanx> of 1,
                and I1 omits the <spanx style="verb">max_path_length</spanx>

              <t>
                Neither TA nor I2 specifies any

                The TA sets the <spanx style="verb">max_path_length</spanx> to 1.

	    This specification uses the syntax of domain name constraints

            As stated there, a domain name constraint MUST be specified as a fully qualified domain name
            and MAY specify a host or a domain. Examples are
            "host.example.com" and ".example.com". When the domain name constraint begins
            with a period, it MAY be expanded with one or more labels.
            That is, the domain name constraint ".example.com" is satisfied by both
            host.example.com and my.host.example.com. However, the domain name constraint
            ".example.com" is not satisfied by "example.com". When the
            domain name constraint does not begin with a period, it specifies a host.
	    As in RFC 5280, domain name constraints apply to the host part of the URI.

	  Per the definition in <xref target="Terminology"/>,
	  Trust Marks are statements of conformance to sets of criteria
	  determined by an accreditation authority.
	  Trust Marks used by this specification are signed JWTs.
	  Entity Statements MAY include Trust Marks,
	  as described in the <spanx style="verb">trust_marks</spanx>
	  Claim definition in <xref target="ec-specific"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Trust Marks are signed by a federation-accredited
          authority called a Trust Mark Issuer.
	  All Trust Mark Issuers MUST be represented in the
          federation by an Entity. The fact that a Trust Mark Issuer is
          accepted by the federation is expressed in the
          <spanx style="verb">trust_mark_issuers</spanx> Claim of the
          Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration.
        </t>
        <t>
          The key used by the Trust Mark
          issuer to sign its Trust Marks MUST be one of the private keys
          in its set of
          Federation Entity Keys.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Trust Mark JWTs MUST include the
	  <spanx style="verb">kid</spanx> (Key ID) header parameter
	  with its value being the Key ID of the signing key used.

        <t>
          Note that a federation MAY allow an Entity to self-sign
          Trust Marks.

        <t>
          Trust Mark JWTs MUST be explicitly typed by using the
          <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> header parameter to prevent
          cross-JWT confusion, per Section 3.11 of <xref target="RFC8725"/>.

          <t>
            Validating a Trust Mark means validating a Trust Mark instance
            represented by a specific signed JWT.
            It is NOT about validating whether a Trust Mark of a particular kind
            can exist or not.
          </t>
          <t>
	    The trust in the Trust Mark Issuer comes before the trust in the trust mark.
              If the Trust Mark Issuer is not trusted then the trust mark cannot be trusted.
              An Entity MUST therefore establish trust in the Trust Mark Issuer by following the procedure defined in
              <xref target="resolving_trust"/> prior to starting the Trust Mark validation process defined below.
	  </t>
      <t>
        Henceforth, "instance" is used as a shorthand for Trust Mark instance.
          The Trust Anchor referenced below is a Trust Anchor that
          has been successfully used when establishing trust in the Trust Mark Issuer.
      </t><t>
        To validate an instance, the following validation steps MUST be performed.
        Please note that if any of these validation checks fail, the entire validation
        process fails and the instance is considered invalid.
        <list style="numbers">
             <t>The instance MUST be a signed JWT</t>
            <t>The instance MUST have a <spanx style="verb">typ</spanx> header with the value
                <spanx style="verb">trust-mark+jwt</spanx>
            </t>
            <t>The instance MUST have an <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx> (algorithm) header parameter with a value
                that is an acceptable JWS signing algorithm; it MUST NOT be <spanx style="verb">none</spanx>.
            </t>
            <t>The Entity Identifier of the Entity whose Entity Configuration contains the instance MUST
                match the value of the Claim <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> in the Trust Mark.</t>
            <t>The current time MUST be after the time represented by the <spanx style="verb">iat</spanx> (issued at) Claim
                (possibly allowing for some small leeway to account for clock skew).</t>
            <t>The current time MUST be before the time represented by the <spanx style="verb">exp</spanx> (expiration) Claim
                (possibly allowing for some small leeway to account for clock skew).</t>
            <t>The instance's signature MUST validate using the Trust Mark issuer's key
                identified by the <spanx style="verb">kid</spanx> value.
            </t>
            <t>If the <spanx style="verb">trust_mark_type</spanx> of the instance appears in the
                <spanx style="verb">trust_mark_owners</spanx> Claim in the Trust Anchor's
                Entity Configuration, then the instance MUST contain a
                <spanx style="verb">delegation</spanx> Claim.</t>
            <t>If there is a <spanx style="verb">delegation</spanx> Claim in the instance, the value of that
            Claim MUST be validated according to <xref target="trust-mark-delegation-validation"/>.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
	  <t>
	    If Trust Marks are issued without an expiration time,
	    it is RECOMMENDED that a mechanism be provided to validate them,
	    such as the Trust Mark Status endpoint
	    and/or the Trust Marked Entities Listing endpoint.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    As an alternative to the above procedure for validating Trust Marks,
	    implementations MAY use the Trust Mark Status endpoint to verify that the
	    Trust Mark is valid and still active, as described in <xref target="status_endpoint"/>.

          <t>
            The basic assumption of this specification is that an Entity
            should have direct trust in no party except the Trust Anchor
            and its own capabilities.
            However, Entities MAY establish a kind of
            transitive trust in other Entities. For example, the
            Trust Anchor states who its Immediate Subordinates are,
            and Entities MAY choose to trust them.
            If a party uses the resolve service of another Entity
            to obtain federation data, it is trusting
            the resolver to perform validation of the cryptographically
            protected metadata correctly and to provide it with authentic results.

          Each Federation Entity MAY publish its previously used
	  Federation Entity Keys at the historical keys endpoint
	  defined in <xref target="federation_entity"/>.
          The purpose of this endpoint is to provide
          the list of keys previously used by the Federation Entity
          to provide non-repudiation of statements signed by
          it after key rotation. This endpoint also discloses the
          reason for the retraction of the keys and whether they were
          expired or revoked, including the reason for the revocation.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that an expired key can be later additionally marked as
          revoked, to indicate a key compromise event discovered
          after the expiration of the key.
        </t>
        <t>
          The publishing of the historical keys guarantees that Trust Chains
          will remain verifiable and usable as inputs to trust decisions
          after the key expiration, unless the key becomes revoked
          for a security reason.

            have changed, either due to expiration or revocation.

          -->
          <t>
            The Federation Historical Keys endpoint
            publishes the list of public keys used in the past by the Entity.
            These keys are needed
            to verify Trust Chains created in the past with
            Entity keys no longer published in the Entity's
            Entity Configuration.
          </t>

          <!--
            give the technical details.
          -->
          <t>
            The Federation Historical Keys endpoint response contains a signed JWT
            that attests to all the expired and revoked Entity keys.
          </t>

          <!--

          <t>
            Based on the attributes contained in the Entity Statements
            that form a Trust Chain, it MAY also be possible to verify
            the non-federation public keys used in the past by Leaf Entities for
            signature operations for OpenID Connect
            requests and responses.
            For example, an Entity Statement issued for a Leaf
            MAY also include the
            <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> Claim for the Leaf's Entity Types,
	    in its
            <spanx style="verb">metadata</spanx> or
            <spanx style="verb">metadata_policy</spanx> Claims.
	  </t>
            <t>
              A simple example: In the following Trust Chain, the
              Federation Intermediate attests to the Leaf's OpenID Connect RP
	      <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx>
              in the Subordinate Statement issued about the Leaf. The result is
              a Trust Chain that contains the Leaf's OpenID Connect RP JWK Set,
              needed to verify historical signature on
              Request Objects and any other signed JWT issued by the Leaf as an RP.
	      This example Trust Chain contains:
              <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                  an Entity Configuration about the RP published by the RP,
                </t>
                <t>
                  a Subordinate Statement about the RP published by Organization A,

	<t>
	  Client authentication is not used at any of the federation endpoints,
	  by default.
	  Federations can choose to make client authentication OPTIONAL, REQUIRED,
	  and/or not allowed at particular federation endpoints.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Client authentication with <spanx style="verb">private_key_jwt</spanx>
	  is the default client authentication method to federation endpoints
	  when client authentication is supported.
	  This client authentication method is described in Section 9 of
	  <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>.
	  The client authentication JWT MUST be signed with a Federation Entity Key.
	  The audience of the JWT MUST be the Entity Identifier
	  of the Entity whose federation endpoint is being authenticated to.
	  The endpoint MUST NOT accept JWTs containing audience values
	  other than its Entity Identifier.
	  When client authentication is used,
	  the request MUST be an HTTP request using the POST method,
	  with the client authentication and endpoint request parameters passed in the POST body.
	  Federations can choose to also use other client authentication methods.

	<section title="Client Authentication Metadata for Federation Endpoints"

	  <t>
	    Like other OAuth and OpenID endpoints supporting client authentication,
	    this specification defines metadata parameters saying which
	    client authentication methods are supported for each endpoint.
	    These largely parallel the
	    <spanx style="verb">token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported</spanx>
	    metadata value defined in Section 3 of
	    <xref target="OpenID.Discovery">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</xref>.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Specifically, for each of the federation endpoints defined in
	    <xref target="federation_entity"/>, parameters named
	    <spanx style="verb">*_auth_methods</spanx>
	    are defined, where the <spanx style="verb">*</spanx> represents the
	    federation endpoint names
	    <spanx style="verb">federation_fetch_endpoint</spanx>,
	    <spanx style="verb">federation_list_endpoint</spanx>, ...,
	    <spanx style="verb">federation_historical_keys_endpoint</spanx>.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The <spanx style="verb">*_auth_methods</spanx>
	    metadata parameters list supported client authentication methods
	    for these endpoints, just as
	    <spanx style="verb">token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported</spanx>
	    does for the Token Endpoint.
	    In addition, the value <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> MAY be used
	    to indicate that client authentication is not required at the endpoint.

      <t>
	The Entity Configuration of all Trust Anchor and Intermediate
	Federation Entities MUST be published
	at their configuration endpoint
	and the Entity Configuration for Leaf Entities SHOULD be published there.
	Its location is determined by concatenating the string
	<spanx style="verb">/.well-known/openid-federation</spanx>
	to the Entity Identifier
	(which MUST use the <spanx style="verb">https</spanx> scheme and
	contain a host component
	and MAY also contain port and path components).
	For instance, the configuration endpoint for the Entity Identifier
	<spanx style="verb">https://entity.example</spanx> is the URL
	<spanx style="verb">https://entity.example/.well-known/openid-federation</spanx>.
	If the Entity Identifier contains a trailing "/" character,

      <t>
        An Entity (Party A) that wants to establish trust with
        another Entity (Party B) MUST have Party B's Entity Identifier and a list of
        Entity Identifiers of Trust Anchors and their public signing keys.
        Party A will first have to fetch
        sufficient Entity Statements to establish at least one chain of trust
        from Party B to one or more of the Trust Anchors.
        After that, Party A MUST validate the Trust Chains independently,
        and if there are multiple valid Trust Chains and if the
        application demands it, choose one to use.
      </t>

      <t>
        To delegate the Trust Chain evaluation to a trusted third party,
        the Entity (Party A) that wants to establish trust with
        another Entity (Party B) MAY use
        a resolve endpoint, as defined in <xref target="resolve"/>.

          Depending on the circumstances, Party A MAY be
          handed Party B's Entity Configuration, or it may
          have to fetch it by itself. If it needs to fetch it, it will use the
          process described in <xref target="federation_configuration"/>
          based on the Entity Identifier of Party B.
        </t>

          The next step is to iterate through the list of

          hints that end in an unknown Trust Anchor,
          requesting an Entity Configuration from each of the Intermediates.
          If the received Entity Configuration contains an authority hint, this
          process is repeated.
        </t>
        <t>
          With the list of all Intermediates and the Trust Anchor, the respective
          fetch endpoints, as defined in <xref target="fetch_endpoint"/>, are used to fetch
          Entity Statements about the Intermediates and Party B.
        </t>
        <t>
          Federation participants MUST NOT attempt to fetch
          Entity Statements they already have obtained during this
          process to prevent loops.
          If a loop is detected, the authority hint that led to it MUST NOT be used.
        </t>
        <t>
          A successful operation will return one or more lists of
          Entity Statements. Each of the lists terminating in a self-signed
          Entity Statement is issued by a Trust Anchor.
        </t>
        <t>
          If there is no path from Party B to at least one of the
          trusted Trust Anchors, then the list will be empty and there is no
          way of establishing trust in Party B's information.
          How Party A deals with this is out of scope for this specification.

      <section title="Validating a Trust Chain" anchor="trust_chain_validation">
        <t>
          As described in <xref target="trust_chain"/>,
          a Trust Chain consists of an ordered list of Entity Statements.
          So however Party A has acquired the set of
          Entity Statements, it MUST now verify that it is a proper Trust Chain
          using the rules laid out in that section.
        </t>
        <t>
	  Let us refer to the Entity Statements in the Trust Chain as
	  ES[j], where j = 0,...,i,
	  with 0 being the index of the first Entity Statement
	  and i being the zero-based index of the last.
	  To validate the Trust Chain, the following MUST be done:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              For each Entity Statement ES[j], where j = 0,..,i:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  Verify that the statement contains all the required Claims.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Verify that <spanx style="verb">iat</spanx> has a value in the
                  past.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Verify that <spanx style="verb">exp</spanx> has a value that
                  is in the future.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              For ES[0] (the Entity Configuration of the Trust Chain subject), verify that
	      <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> == <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>.
            </t>
            <t>
              For ES[0], verify that its signature validates with a public key
	      in ES[0]["jwks"].
            </t>
            <t>
              For each j = 0,...,i-1, verify that ES[j]["iss"] == ES[j+1]["sub"].
            </t>
            <t>
              For each j = 0,...,i-1, verify that the signature of ES[j] validates with a public
              key in ES[j+1]["jwks"].
            </t>
            <t>
              For ES[i] (the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration), verify that
	      the issuer matches the Entity Identifier of the Trust Anchor.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      For ES[i], verify that
	      its signature validates with a public key of the Trust Anchor.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Verifying the signature is a much more expensive
          operation than verifying the correctness of the statement and the
          timestamps. An implementer MAY therefore choose not to verify the
          signatures until all the other checks have been done.
        </t>
        <t>
	  Federation participants MAY cache Entity Statements and signature verification
          results until they expire, per
          <xref target="trust_lifetime"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          After the preceding validation, metadata MUST be resolved to the subject
          of the Trust Chain, as described in <xref target="metadata_policy_enforcement"/>.
          Furthermore, constraints MUST be enforced for each Subordinate Statement of the Trust Chain,
          as explained in <xref target="chain_constraints"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="choosing-chain" title="Choosing One of the Valid Trust Chains">
        <t>
          If multiple valid Trust Chains are found, Party A will
          need to decide on which one to use.
	  One simple rule would be to prefer a shorter chain over a longer one.
	  Federation participants MAY follow other rules according to local policy.

               title="Calculating the Expiration Time of a Trust Chain">
        <t>
          Each Entity Statement in a Trust Chain is signed and MUST have an
          expiration time (<spanx style="verb">exp</spanx>).
          The expiration time of the whole Trust Chain is the minimum
          (<spanx style="verb">exp</spanx>) value within the Trust Chain.

      </section>

      <section title="Transient Trust Chain Validation Errors"
               anchor="transient_trust_chain_validation_errors">
        <t>
          If the federation topology is being updated, for example, when a set
          of Leaf Entities is moved to a new Intermediate Entity, the Trust Chain
          validation may fail in a transient manner. Retrying after a period of
          time may resolve the situation.

      </section>

      <section title="Resolving the Trust Chain and Metadata with a Resolver"
	       anchor="ResolvingWithResolver">
	<t>
	  Note that an alternative method for resolving a Trust Chain
	  for an Entity (Party B) using the methods described above
	  is to use a resolve endpoint, as described in <xref target="resolve"/>.
	  This lets the resolver do the work that otherwise the Entity (Party A)
	  wanting to establish trust would have to do for itself.

      <t>
        As described in <xref target="trust_lifetime"/>,
        each Trust Chain has an expiration time.
        Federation participants MUST support
        refreshing a Trust Chain when it expires.
        How often a participant reevaluates the Trust Chain depends on

        <t>
	  The expiration time (<spanx style="verb">exp</spanx>)

               anchor="key_rollover_anchor">
        <t>
          A Trust Anchor MUST publish an Entity Configuration about itself.
          The expiration time (<spanx style="verb">exp</spanx>) set on this Entity Configuration should be chosen
          such that it ensures that federation participants re-fetch it at reasonable intervals.
          When a Trust Anchor rolls over its signing keys, it needs to:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="numbers">

            <t>
              Keep signing the Entity Configuration and the Entity Statements using
              the old keys for a long enough time period to allow all
              Subordinates to have obtained the new keys.
            </t>
            <t>
              Switch to signing with the new keys.
            </t>
            <t>
              After a reasonable time period, remove the old keys. What is
              regarded as a reasonable time is dependent on the security profile
              and risk assessment of the Trust Anchor.

      <section title="Redundant Retrieval of Trust Anchor Keys" anchor="TrustAnchorKeys">
        <t>
          It is RECOMMENDED that Federation Operators provide a means of retrieving the public keys
          for the Trust Anchors it administers that is independent of those Trust Anchors' Entity Configurations.
          This is intended to provide redundancy in the eventuality of the compromise of
          the Web PKI <xref target="RFC9525"/> infrastructure underlying retrieval of public keys from Entity Configurations.
        </t>
        <t>
          The keys retrieved via the independent mechanism specified by the Federation Operator
          SHOULD be compared to those retrieved via the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration.
          If they do not match, both SHOULD be retrieved again.
          If they still do not match, it is indicative of a security or configuration problem.
          The appropriate remediation steps in that eventuality SHOULD be specified by the Federation Operator.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="revocation" title="Revocation">
        <t>
          Since the participants in federations are expected to check the Trust Chain on a regular
          frequent basis, this specification does not define a
          revocation process. Specific federations MAY make a
          different choice and will then have to define their own revocation process.

    <section title="OpenID Connect Client Registration" anchor="client_registration">
      <t>
        This section describes how the mechanisms defined in this specification
        can be used to establish trust between an RP and an OP that have no
        prior explicit configuration or registration between them. It defines
        two client registration methods, Automatic Registration and Explicit
        Registration, that use Trust Chains, per <xref target="resolving_trust"/>.
        Federations can use other appropriate methods for client registration.
      </t>
      <t>
        Federations with OpenID Connect Entities SHOULD agree on the supported
        client registration methods.
      </t>
      <t>
	Note that both Automatic Registration and Explicit Registration
	can also be used for OAuth 2.0 profiles other than OpenID Connect.
	To do so, rather than using the Entity Type Identifiers
	<spanx style="verb">openid_relying_party</spanx> and
	<spanx style="verb">openid_provider</spanx>,
	one would instead use the Entity Type Identifiers
	<spanx style="verb">oauth_client</spanx> and
	<spanx style="verb">oauth_authorization_server</spanx>,
	or possibly other Entity Type Identifiers defined for the specific
	OAuth 2.0 profile being used.

      <section title="Automatic Registration" anchor="automatic">
        <t>
          Automatic Registration enables an RP to make Authentication Requests
          without a prior registration step with the OP.
          The OP resolves the RP's Entity Configuration from the Client ID in the Authentication Request,
          following the process defined in <xref target="resolving_trust"/>.
        </t>
          <t>
              The RP MUST perform Trust Chain and metadata resolution for the OP, as specified in
              <xref target="resolving_trust"/> before it sends the Authentication Request. If the resolution is not
              successful, the RP MUST NOT attempt further interactions with the OP.
          </t>
        <t>
          Automatic Registration has the following characteristics:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              In all interactions with the OP, the RP employs its Entity Identifier as the Client ID.
              The OP retrieves the RP's Entity Configuration
              from the URL derived from the Entity Identifier, as
              described in <xref target="federation_configuration"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
              Since there is no registration step prior to the Authentication Request,
	      asymmetric cryptography MUST be used to authenticate requests
	      when using Automatic Registration.
	      Asymmetric cryptography is used to authenticate requests;
	      therefore, the OP neither assigns a Client Secret to the RP
	      nor returns it as a result of the registration process.

	    Deployments MAY choose not to support passing the request object

	    It is an OAuth 2.0 authorization error response
	    sent to the Client's redirection URI,
	    unless a <xref target="RFC9126">Pushed Authorization Request</xref>
	    was used for the request.

	    However, as in both <xref target="OpenID.Core"/> and <xref target="RFC6749"/>,

	    and instead the Authorization Server SHOULD inform the End-User

	  </t>
	  <t>
	    If the OP fails to establish trust with the RP or
	    finds the RP metadata to be invalid or in conflict with metadata policy,
	    it MUST treat the redirection URI as invalid
	    and not perform redirection.
	    This means that the error codes
	    <spanx style="verb">invalid_trust_anchor</spanx>,

	  <t>
	    Note that when using Automatic Registration,
	    the client authentication methods that the client can use
	    are declared to the OP using RP Metadata parameters: either the
	    <spanx style="verb">token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported</spanx>
	    parameter defined in <xref target="OpenID.RP.Choices"/> or the
	    <spanx style="verb">token_endpoint_auth_method</spanx> parameter.
	    Those that the OP can use are likewise
	    declared to the RP using OP Metadata parameters.
	    However, if there are multiple methods supported by both
	    the RP and the OP, the OP does not know which one the RP will pick
	    in advance of it being used,
	    since this is not declared at the time the Automatic Registration occurs.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    OPs SHOULD accept any client authentication method that is mutually supported
	    and RPs MUST only use mutually supported methods.
	    Because some OPs may be coded in such a way that
	    they expect the RP to always use the same client authentication method
	    for subsequent interactions, note that
	    interoperability may be improved by the RP doing so.

        <section title="Possible Other Uses of Automatic Registration" anchor="AutomaticRegistrationOtherUses">
          <t>
            Automatic Registration is designed to be able to be
            employed for OAuth 2.0 use cases beyond OpenID Connect,
	    as noted in <xref target="client_registration"/>.
            For instance, ecosystems using
            bare <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref> or
            <xref target="FAPI">FAPI</xref> can utilize Automatic Registration.
          </t>
	  <t>
	    Also note that Client ID values that are Entity Identifiers
	    could be used to identify clients using Automatic Registration
	    at endpoints other than the Authorization Endpoint and Token Endpoint
	    in OAuth 2.0 deployments, such as
	    the Pushed Authorization Request (PAR) Endpoint
	    and Introspection Endpoint.
	    Describing particular such scenarios is beyond the scope of this specification.

      <section title="Explicit Registration" anchor="explicit">
        <t>
          Using this method, the RP establishes its client registration with the
          OP by means of a dedicated registration request, similar to
          <xref target="OpenID.Registration"/>, but instead of its metadata, the
          RP submits its Entity Configuration or an entire Trust Chain. When
          the Explicit Registration is completed, the RP can proceed to
          make regular OpenID authentication requests to the OP.
        </t>

        <t>
          An OP that supports Explicit Registration MUST include the
          <spanx style="verb">explicit</spanx> keyword in its
          <spanx style="verb">client_registration_types_supported</spanx>
          metadata parameter and set the
          <spanx style="verb">federation_registration_endpoint</spanx> metadata
          parameter to the URL at which it receives Explicit Registration requests.
        </t>

        <t>
          Explicit Registration is suitable for implementation on top of the
          <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client
          Registration 1.0</xref> endpoint of an OP deployment. In contrast to
          Automatic Registration, it enables an OP to provision a Client ID,
	  potentially a Client Secret, and other metadata parameters.
        </t>

        <t>An example of an Explicit Registration is provided in
          <xref target="ExplicitRegExample"/>.
        </t>

          <section anchor="Cliregreq" title="Explicit Client Registration Request">
            <t>
              The RP performs Explicit Client Registration as follows:
            </t>
            <t>
              <list style="numbers">

                <t>
                  Once the RP has determined a set of Trust Anchors it has in common with the OP,
                  it chooses the subset it wants to proceed with. This
                  may be a single Trust Anchor, or it can also be more than one.
                  The RP MUST perform Trust Chain and metadata resolution for
                  the OP, as specified in <xref target="resolving_trust"/>. If
                  the resolution is not successful, the RP MUST abort the
                  request.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Using this subset of Trust Anchors, the RP chooses a set of
                  <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
                  from the hints that are available to it. Each hint MUST,
                  when used as a starting point for Trust Chain collection,
                  lead to at least one of the Trust Anchors in the subset.
                  If the RP has more than one Trust Anchor in common with the
                  OP it MUST select a subset of Trust Anchors to proceed with.
                  The subset may be as small as a single Trust Anchor, or
                  include multiple ones.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The RP will then construct its Entity Configuration,
                  where the metadata statement chosen is influenced by the OP's
                  metadata and where the
                  <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
                  included are picked by the process described above.
                  From its Immediate Superiors, the RP MUST select
                  one or more <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx> so
                  that every hint, when used as the starting point for a Trust Chain
                  collection, leads to at least one of the Trust Anchors
                  in the subset selected above.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The RP MAY include its Entity Configuration
                  in a Trust Chain regarding itself.
                  There are two ways to do this.
		  The first way is for the Registration Request to contain an
                  array with the sequence of
                  Entity Statements that compose the Trust Chain
                  between the RP that is making the request and the
                  selected Trust Anchor.
		  The second way is to use the
		  <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> header parameter,
		  as specified in <xref target="trust_chain_head_param"/>.
		  <vspace blankLine="1"/>

		  NOTE: The use of the
		  <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> header parameter
		  in the request JWT is RECOMMENDED over the first syntax;
		  it is retained for historical reasons.
		</t>
		<t>
                  The RP MUST include its
                  metadata in its Entity Configuration and use the
                  <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx> selected above.
                  <vspace blankLine="1"/>

                  The RP SHOULD select its metadata parameters to comply with
                  the OP's Resolved Metadata and thus ensure a successful
                  registration with the OP. Note that if the submitted RP
                  metadata is not compliant with the metadata of the OP, the
                  OP may choose to modify it to make it compliant
                  rather than reject the request with an error response.
                </t>

                <t>
                  The Entity Configuration, or the entire Trust Chain,
                  is sent, using HTTP POST, to the
                  <spanx style="verb">federation_registration_endpoint</spanx>.
                  The Entity Configuration or Trust Chain is the entire POST body.
                  The RP MUST sign its Entity Configuration with a current
                  Federation Entity Key in its possession.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The content type of the Registration Request MUST be
                  <spanx style="verb">application/entity-statement+jwt</spanx>
                  when it is the Entity Configuration of the requestor.
                  Otherwise, when it is a Trust Chain, the
                  content type of the Registration Request MUST be
                  <spanx style="verb">application/trust-chain+json</spanx>.
                  The RP MAY include its Entity Configuration in a Trust Chain
                  that leads to the RP. In this case, the registration request
                  will contain an array consisting of the sequence of
                  statements that make up the Trust Chain between the RP and
                  the Trust Anchor the RP selected.
                </t>
		<t>
		  The <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> header parameter
		  MAY be included to provide a Trust Chain between the RP
		  and the Trust Anchor the RP selected
		  when the request is the Entity Configuration of the RP.
		  This is equivalent to providing the Trust Chain as the request body.
		  When the <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> header parameter
		  is included,
		  the <spanx style="verb">peer_trust_chain</spanx> header parameter
		  MAY also be included to provide a Trust Chain between the OP
		  and the Trust Anchor the RP selected.
		  The Peer Trust Chain contains metadata and policy values
		  that the RP has chosen for the OP to use during the registration.
		  The <spanx style="verb">peer_trust_chain</spanx> header parameter
		  MUST NOT be used when the request body is a Trust Chain.
		  The Trust Anchors selected in both Trust Chains MUST be the same.
		  Inclusion of both Trust Chains enables achieving
		  the Federation Integrity and Metadata Integrity properties,
		  as defined in <xref target="App-Fed-Linkage"/>.

              <t>
                The OP processes the request as follows:
              </t>
              <t>
                <list style="numbers">
                  <t>
                    Upon receiving a registration request, the OP MUST inspect
                    the content type to determine whether it contains an Entity Configuration
                    or an entire Trust Chain.
                  </t>
		  <t>
		    The OP MUST validate the RP's explicit registration request JWT.
		    All the normal Entity Statement validation rules apply.
		    In addition, if the <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> (audience)
		    Claim Value is not the Entity Identifier of the OP,
		    then the request MUST be rejected.
		  </t>
                  <t>
                    If no Trust Chain is provided from the RP to the Trust Anchor
		    in the request, the OP MUST use the provided Entity Configuration
		    to complete the Federation Entity Discovery by
                    collecting and evaluating the Trust Chains that start with
                    the <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx> in the
                    Entity Configuration of the RP. After validating at least
                    one Trust Chain, the OP MUST verify the signature of the
                    received Entity Configuration. If the OP finds more than
                    one acceptable Trust Chain, it MUST choose one Trust Chain
                    from among them as the one to proceed with.
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    If the request body is a Trust Chain, the OP MAY evaluate
                    the statements in the Trust Chain to save the HTTP calls
                    that are necessary to perform the Federation Entity Discovery,
                    especially if the RP included more than one
                    authority hint in its Entity Configuration. Otherwise, the
                    OP MUST extract the RP's Entity Configuration from the Trust Chain
                    and proceed according to Step 3,
		    as if only an Entity Configuration was received.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    When a Trust Chain is provided using the
		    <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> header parameter
		    in the request's Entity Configuration,
		    the OP MAY likewise evaluate
		    the statements in the Trust Chain to save the HTTP calls
		    that are necessary to perform the Federation Entity Discovery.
		    Note that in this case, the RP's Entity Configuration
		    in the Trust Chain is only used to establish that
		    there is a path from the RP to the Trust Anchor;
		    it is the metadata, etc. in the request Entity Configuration,
		    which may be tailored by the RP for the OP,
		    that is used when processing the registration request.
		    If the provided Trust Chain is not used,
		    the OP MUST proceed according to Step 3,
		    using the request Entity Configuration.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    If the request uses
		    the <spanx style="verb">peer_trust_chain</spanx> header parameter
		    to include a Trust Chain from the OP
		    to the Trust Anchor that the RP selected,
		    verify that it begins at the OP.
		    Furthermore, verify that it ends at the same Trust Anchor
		    as any provided Trust chain from the RP to the Trust Anchor.
		    The OP SHOULD use the metadata and policy values
		    that the RP has chosen during the registration.
		  </t>
                  <t>
                    At this point, if the OP finds that it already has an
                    existing client registration for the requesting RP, then
                    that registration MUST be invalidated. The precise time of
                    the invalidation is at the OP's discretion, as the OP may
                    want to ensure the completion of concurrent OpenID
                    authentication requests initiated by the RP while the
                    registration request is being processed.
                    <vspace blankLine="1"/>

                    The OP MAY retain client credentials and key material from
                    the invalidated registration in order to verify past RP
                    signatures and perform other cryptographic operations on
                    past RP data.

                  <t>
                    The OP uses the Resolved Metadata for the RP to create a client
                    registration compliant with its own OP metadata and other
                    applicable policies.
                    <vspace blankLine="1"/>

                    The OP MAY provision the RP with a
                    <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx> other than the RP's
                    Entity Identifier. This enables Explicit Registration to be
                    implemented on top of the
                    <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic

                    If the RP is provisioned with a

                    expire before the expiration of the registration Entity Statement
                    that will be returned to the RP.
                    <vspace blankLine="1"/>

                    The OP SHOULD NOT provision the RP with a
                    <spanx style="verb">registration_access_token</spanx> and a
                    <spanx style="verb">registration_client_uri</spanx>
                    because the expected way for the RP to update its
                    registration is to make a new Explicit Registration
                    request. If the RP is provisioned with a
                    <spanx style="verb">registration_access_token</spanx> for
                    some purpose, for example, to let it independently check its
                    registered metadata, the token MUST NOT allow modification
                    of the registration.
                    <vspace blankLine="1"/>

                    The OP MAY modify the received RP metadata, for example, by
                    substituting an invalid or unsupported parameter,
                    to make it compliant with its own OP metadata and other
                    policies. If the OP does not accept the RP metadata or is
                    unwilling to modify it to make it compliant, it
                    MUST return a client registration error response, with an
                    appropriate error, such as
                    <spanx style="verb">invalid_client_metadata</spanx> or

            An RP can utilize the <spanx style="verb">exp</spanx> Claim of the
            registration Entity Statement to devise a suitable strategy for
            renewing its client registration. RP implementers should note that
            if the RP's registration has expired at the OP,
	    this can cause OpenID Connect authentication requests, token requests,
	    and/or UserInfo requests to fail. Renewing the RP's registration
            prior to its expiration can prevent such errors from
            occurring and ensure the end-user experience is not disrupted.
          </t>
          <t>
            An OP MAY invalidate a client registration before the expiration
            that is indicated in the registration Entity Statement for the RP.
            An example reason could be the OP leaving the federation that was
            used to register the RP.

      <section title="Registration Validity and Trust Reevaluation" anchor="client_reg_trust_re_eval">
        <t>
          The validity of an Automatic or Explicit Registration at an OP MUST
          NOT exceed the lifetime of the Trust Chain the OP used to create the
          registration. An OP MAY choose to expire the registration at some
          earlier time, or choose to perform additional periodic reevaluations
          of the Trust Chain for the registered RP before the Trust Chain
          reaches its expiration time.
        </t>
        <t>
          Similarly, an RP that obtained an Automatic or Explicit Registration
          MUST NOT use it past the expiration of the Trust Chain the RP used to
          establish trust in the OP. For an RP using Automatic Registration, the
          trust in the OP MUST be successfully reevaluated before continuing to
          make requests to the OP. For an RP using Explicit Registration, the RP
          MUST successfully renew its registration. An RP MAY choose to perform
          additional periodic reevaluations of the Trust Chain for the OP
          before the Trust Chain reaches its expiration time.

          The primary differences between Automatic Registration and Explicit Registration are:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              With Automatic Registration, there is no registration step prior to the Authentication Request,
              whereas with Explicit Registration, there is.
              (<xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>
              and <xref target="RFC7591">OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration</xref>
              also employ a prior registration step.)
            </t>
            <t>
              With Automatic Registration, the Client ID value is the RP's Entity Identifier
              and is supplied to the OP by the RP,
              whereas with Explicit Registration, a Client ID is assigned by the OP and supplied to the RP.
            </t>
            <t>
	      With Automatic Registration, the Client is authenticated by means of
	      the RP proving that it controls a private key
              corresponding to one of its Entity Configuration's public keys.
	      Whereas with Explicit Registration, a broader set of options
	      is available for authenticating the Client,
	      including the use of a Client Secret.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Rationale for Trust Chains in the Request" anchor="TrustChainRationale">
        <t>
          Both Automatic and Explicit Client Registration support
          the submission of the Trust Chain embedded in the Request,
          calculated by the requestor, and related to itself.

          This provides the following benefits:
          <list style="symbols">

          <t>
            It solves the problem of OPs using RP metadata that has become stale.
            This stale data may occur when the OP uses cached RP metadata from a Trust Chain
            that has not reached its expiration time yet.
            The RP MAY notify the OP that a change has taken place by including
            the <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> header parameter
            or the <spanx style="verb">trust_chain</spanx> request parameter
	    in the request,
            thus letting the OP update its Client Registration
	    and preventing potential temporary faults due to stale metadata.
          </t>

          <t>
            It enables the RP to pass a verifiable hint for which trust path to
            take to build the Trust Chain. This can reduce the costs
            of RP Federation Entity Discovery for OPs in complex federations where the
            RP has multiple Trust Anchors or the Trust Chain resolution may
            result in dead-ends.
          </t>

          <t>
            It enables direct passing of the Entity Configuration, including
            any present Trust Marks, thus saving the OP from having to make
            an HTTP request to the RP
            <spanx style="verb">/.well-known/openid-federation</spanx>
            endpoint.
          </t>

	  </list>
        </t>
	<t>
	  Both also support the submission of the Peer Trust Chain,
	  which provides a Trust Chain between the OP
	  and the Trust Anchor the RP selected.
	  As described in <xref target="peer_trust_chain_head_param"/>,
	  inclusion of both Trust Chains enables achieving
	  the Federation Integrity and Metadata Integrity properties,

	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> (JSON Web Key Set) Claim
	  value is a JWK Set, as defined in <xref target="RFC7517"/>.
	  It is used to convey a set of cryptographic keys.
	  Use of this Claim is OPTIONAL.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For instance, the <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> (JSON Web Key Set) Claim
	  might be used to represent a set of signing keys for an application.
	  This Claim is used in this specification as specified in <xref target="common-claims"/>

	  Its value is a JSON object.
	  The details of the metadata contained are application-specific.
	  Use of this Claim is OPTIONAL.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For instance, the <spanx style="verb">metadata</spanx> Claim
	  might be used to represent a set of endpoint URLs
	  and algorithm identifiers in an API description.
	  This Claim is used in this specification as specified in <xref target="common-claims"/>
	  to represent metadata about the Entity.

	  Its value is a JSON object.
	  The details of the constraints contained are application-specific.
	  Use of this Claim is OPTIONAL.

	<t>
	  For instance,

      <section anchor="critClaim" title='"crit" (Critical) Claim'>
	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">crit</spanx> (critical) Claim
	  indicates that extensions to the set of Claims
	  specified for use in this type of JWT are being used
	  that MUST be understood and processed.
	  It is used in the same way that
	  the <spanx style="verb">crit</spanx> header parameter
	  is used for extension JOSE header parameters
	  that MUST be understood and processed.
	  Its value is an array listing the Claim Names
	  present in the JWT that use those extensions.
	  If any of the listed Claims are not
	  understood and supported by the recipient, then the JWT is invalid.
	  Producers MUST NOT include Claim Names already
	  specified for use in this type of JWT,
	  duplicate names, or
	  names that do not occur as Claim Names in the JWT
	  in the <spanx style="verb">crit</spanx> list.
	  Producers MUST NOT use the empty array
	  <spanx style="verb">[]</spanx>
	  as the <spanx style="verb">crit</spanx> value.
	  Use of this Claim is OPTIONAL.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Section 4 of <xref target="RFC7519"/> states that
	  "Specific applications of JWTs will require implementations
	  to understand and process some claims in particular ways.
	  However, in the absence of such requirements, all claims
	  that are not understood by implementations MUST be ignored."
	  Thus, for the <spanx style="verb">crit</spanx> (critical) Claim to be effective,
	  the definition for the particular kind of JWT using it MUST
	  specify that <spanx style="verb">crit</spanx> MUST be
	  understood and processed, as allowed in the statement above.

      <section anchor="refClaim" title='"ref" (Reference) Claim'>
	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">ref</spanx> (reference) Claim
	  is used for conveying the URI for a resource pertaining to the JWT.
	  It plays a similar role in a JWT as
	  the <spanx style="verb">href</spanx> property does in HTML.
	  The nature of the content at the referenced resource
	  is generally application specific.
	  The <spanx style="verb">ref</spanx> value is a case-sensitive string
	  containing a URI value.
	  Use of this Claim is OPTIONAL.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For instance, a JWT referring to a contract between two parties might use
	  the <spanx style="verb">ref</spanx> (reference) Claim
	  to refer to a resource at which the contract terms can be read.
	  This Claim is used in this specification as specified in <xref target="trust_mark_claims"/>

	  The <spanx style="verb">delegation</spanx> Claim expresses that
	  authority is being delegated to the party referenced in the Claim Value.
	  The <spanx style="verb">delegation</spanx> value is a case-sensitive string
	  containing a StringOrURI value.
	  Use of this Claim is OPTIONAL.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For instance, the <spanx style="verb">delegation</spanx> Claim
	  might be used to express that the referenced party may sign
	  a legal document on behalf of the subject.
	  This Claim is used in this specification as specified in <xref target="trust_mark_claims"/>
	  to represent delegation of the right to issue Trust Marks
	  with a particular identifier.

	<t>
	  Note that the <spanx style="verb">delegation</spanx> Claim is both
	  syntactically and semantically distinct from the existing
	  <spanx style="verb">act</spanx> Claim <xref target="IANA.JWT.Claims"/>.
	  <spanx style="verb">act</spanx> is a JSON object whereas
	  <spanx style="verb">delegation</spanx> is a StringOrURI.
	  Semantically, the Delegation JWT defined in <xref target="delegation_jwt"/>
	  carries a signature by an issuer cryptographically proving
	  the right to delegate to the party.
	  The <spanx style="verb">act</spanx> Claim, carrying no signature,

	  In this topology, there are multiple trust paths between
	  the RP and the Trust Anchor, meaning that
	  multiple different Trust Chains could be built between them.
	  If the metadata policies of Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 are different,
	  this could result in the Resolved Metadata for the RP differing,
	  depending upon which Intermediate is used when building the Trust Chain.
	  Some such differences will be innocuous and some can cause failures.

	<t>
	  It is the job of the Federation architects to deploy topologies and
	  metadata policies that work as intended, no matter which trust path
	  is chosen when building a Trust Chain.
	  Of course, one way to avoid potential ambiguities is to only use
	  topologies that are trees, without multiple paths between two Entities.
	  Topologies that are not trees are permitted,

	      <strong>Trust Chain Resolution</strong>: The process of building and validating a Trust Chain
	      from a known entity to a Trust Anchor, as described in <xref target="resolving_trust"/>.
	      This process is also known as Federation Entity Discovery in this specification
	      (per the definition in <xref target="Terminology"/>).

	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>
	  While these patterns may involve both discovery and Trust Chain resolution, they serve different
	  purposes and may be used independently, depending on the use case. For example, a discovery service
	  building a directory of OpenID Providers may collect entity identifiers without necessarily
	  resolving Trust Chains for all discovered entities, since the actual Trust Chain resolution
	  may occur later on, for example, when an RP and OP engage in an authentication transaction,
          and use the Trust Chain resolution process described in <xref target="resolving_trust"/>.

	  Implementations may support one or more of the following patterns:

	  Federation operators may choose to support multiple patterns to accommodate different use cases
	  and integration scenarios. The choice of supported patterns affects the federation's usability
	  and the types of applications that can effectively integrate with it.
	</t>

	<section title="Bottom-Up Trust Chain Resolution" anchor="bottom_up_discovery">
	  <t>
	    Bottom-up Trust Chain resolution is the process described in <xref target="resolving_trust"/>,
	    also known as Federation Entity Discovery (see the definition in the Terminology section).
	    This process starts with a known Entity Identifier and builds a Trust Chain by traversing up the
	    federation hierarchy until reaching a Trust Anchor. This pattern is not discovery in the sense of
	    finding unknown entities, but rather trust resolution for a known entity.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    This pattern is used when an entity needs to verify the trustworthiness of another entity whose
	    Entity Identifier is already known. This is typically used for:
	    <list style="symbols">
	      <t>OpenID Providers verifying Relying Parties during authentication requests,</t>
	      <t>Resource servers verifying Client trustworthiness,</t>
	      <t>Any Entity validating incoming requests from known parties, and</t>
	      <t>Dynamic trust establishment in federated environments.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    The bottom-up Trust Chain resolution process follows these steps, as described in <xref target="resolving_trust"/>:
	    <list style="numbers">
	      <t>Start with the subject entity's Entity Configuration (provided or fetched using the process defined in <xref target="federation_configuration"/>).</t>
	      <t>Use <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx> to identify immediate superior entities.</t>
	      <t>Fetch Entity Configuration for each Superior Entity.</t>
	      <t>Use Fetch Endpoints (as defined in <xref target="fetch_statement"/>) to obtain Subordinate Statements about the subject entity.</t>
	      <t>Recursively traverse up the hierarchy until reaching a Trust Anchor.</t>
	      <t>Build and validate the complete Trust Chain.</t>
	      <t>Apply federation policies to derive Resolved Metadata.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>
	</section>

	<section title="Top-Down Discovery" anchor="top_down_discovery">
	  <t>
	    Top-down discovery is the process of finding entities that are part of a federation by starting
	    from a known Trust Anchor and traversing down the federation hierarchy. This pattern is used
	    when the goal is to discover available entities, particularly entities of specific Entity Types,
	    without necessarily knowing their Entity Identifiers in advance.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    This pattern is particularly useful for:
	    <list style="symbols">
	      <t>Service discovery by Relying Parties looking for OpenID Providers,</t>
	      <t>Resource discovery by Clients looking for specific service types,</t>
	      <t>Federation browsing and exploration, and</t>
	      <t>Building provider directories and catalogs (e.g., WAYF services, Seamless Access).</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    The top-down discovery process follows these steps:
	    <list style="numbers">
	      <t>Start with a known Trust Anchor that the discovering entity trusts.</t>
	      <t>Use the list endpoint (as defined in <xref target="entity_listing"/>) to discover Immediate Subordinate entities.</t>
	      <t>Filter by <spanx style="verb">entity_type</spanx> parameter to find protocol-specific providers (e.g., <spanx style="verb">openid_provider</spanx>).</t>
	      <t>For Intermediate entities, recursively traverse their Subordinates.</t>
	      <t>Collect Entity Identifiers and optionally Entity Configurations for discovered entities.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Note that top-down discovery may or may not include Trust Chain resolution, depending on the use case.
	    For example, when building a directory of OpenID Providers for user selection at login time, the discovery
	    service may collect entity identifiers and basic metadata without resolving Trust Chains for all discovered
	    entities. However, if the discovery service needs to verify that entities
	    are properly registered in the federation before including them in the directory, it may choose to perform Trust Chain resolution as part of the discovery process.
	  </t>

	</section>

	<section title="Single Point of Trust Resolution" anchor="single_point_discovery">
	  <t>
	    Single point of trust resolution delegates the entire Trust Chain resolution process to a trusted
	    resolver implementing the Resolve Endpoint defined in <xref target="resolve"/>. This pattern allows
	    entities to offload the complexity of Trust Chain resolution to a specialized service.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    This pattern is useful for:
	    <list style="symbols">
	      <t>Entities that want to offload Trust Chain resolution complexity,</t>
	      <t>Centralized trust evaluation services,</t>

	      <t>Simplified integration for lightweight clients.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Note that this pattern requires the Entity Identifier of the subject entity to be known in advance.
	    It does not provide discovery functionality in the sense of finding unknown entities within a federation.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    The single point of trust resolution process follows these steps:

	      <t>Identify a trusted resolver with a Resolve Endpoint.</t>
	      <t>Submit the subject Entity Identifier and Trust Anchor to the resolver.</t>
	      <t>The resolver performs complete Trust Chain resolution internally (following the bottom-up pattern).</t>
	      <t>The resolver returns Resolved Metadata and Trust Marks.</t>

      <section anchor="anchor_resolver" title="Trust Anchors and Resolvers Go Together">
        <t>
        If only one resolver is present in a federation, that entity should be
        both Trust Anchor and Resolver. If so, users of the resolver will not have to
        collect and evaluate Trust Chains for the Resolver. The Trust Anchor is by definition trusted
        and if the entity also serves as Resolver, that service will be implicitly trusted.
        </t>
      </section>
    <section anchor="one_service" title="One Entity, One Service">
        <t>
        Apart from letting an entity provide both the Trust Anchor and Resolver services, there is a good reason for

                    be used for the application protocol.

                    <vspace/>
                    A federation MAY have a policy that states that only Trust Marks that
                    match certain criteria SHOULD be used.
                    <vspace/>
                    An example of such criteria could be that the Trust Mark's
                    <spanx style="verb">trust_mark_type</spanx> must be
                    listed in the Trust Anchor's <spanx style="verb">trust_mark_issuers</spanx>,
                    and if so, that the instance's <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> appears in the corresponding list of

                    An Entity MAY also choose, at its own discretion, to utilize Trust Marks presented to it that are not

      <section title="Denial-of-Service Attack Prevention" anchor="DoS">
        <t>
          Some of the interfaces defined in this specification could be used for
          Denial-of-Service attacks (DoS), most notably, the resolve endpoint
          (<xref target="resolve"/>), Explicit Client Registration
          (<xref target="explicit"/>), and
          Automatic Client Registration (<xref target="automatic"/>) can
          be exploited as vectors of HTTP propagation attacks.
          Below is an explanation of how such an attack can occur and
          the countermeasures to prevent it.
        </t>
        <t>
          An adversary, providing hundreds of fake
          <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
          in its Entity Configuration,
          could exploit the Federation Entity Discovery mechanism
          to propagate many HTTP requests.
          Imagine an adversary controlling an RP that sends an authorization
          request to an OP. For each request crafted
          by the adversary, the OP produces one request for
          the adversary's Entity Configuration and another one
          for each URL found in the <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>.
        </t>
        <t>
          If these endpoints are provided, some adequate defense methods are required,
          such as those described below and in
          <xref target="RFC4732"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Implementations should set a limit on the number of
          <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
          they are willing to inspect. This is to protect against attacks
          where an adversary might define a large count of false
          <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
          in their Entity Configuration.
        </t>
        <t>
          Entities may be required to include a
          Trust Chain
          in their requests, as explained in <xref target="UsingAuthzRequestObject"/>.
          The static Trust Chain gives a predefined trust path,
          meaning that Federation Entity Discovery need not be performed.
          In this case, the propagation attacks will
          be prevented since the Trust Chain can be statically validated with
          a public key of the Trust Anchor.
        </t>
        <t>
          A Trust Mark can be statically validated using the public key of its issuer.
          The static validation of the Trust Marks represents a
          filter against propagation attacks.
          If the OpenID Provider (OP) discovers at least one valid Trust Mark
          within an Entity Configuration, this may serve as evidence of
          the reliability of the Relying Party that initiated the request.
          Given that the Trust Mark is optional, the decision to require
          one is at the discretion of the federation implementation,
          where a federation may define and require Trust Marks
          according to specific needs.
        </t>
        <t>
          If Client authentication is not required at the resolve endpoint,
          then incoming requests should not automatically trigger the collection
          (Federation Entity Discovery process) and assessment of Trust Chains.
          Instead, the resolve endpoint should only respond to unauthenticated
          Client requests with cached information about Entities that have
          already been evaluated and deemed trustworthy. The initiation of
          the Federation Entity Discovery process should not be the default
          action for the resolve endpoint in this case.
        </t>
	<t>
	  Passing request objects by reference (using the
	  <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> request parameter)
	  may not be supported by some deployments,
	  as described in <xref target="authn-request"/>, to eliminate a mechanism
	  by which an attacker could otherwise require OPs
	  to retrieve arbitrary content under the control of the attacker.

      <section title="Unsigned Error Messages" anchor="UnsignedError">
        <t>
          One of the fundamental design goals of this protocol is to
          protect messages end-to-end. This cannot be accomplished by demanding
          TLS since TLS, in lots of cases, is not end-to-end but ends in an HTTPS
          to HTTP Reverse Proxy.
          Allowing unsigned error messages therefore opens an attack
          vector for someone who wants to run a Denial-of-Service attack.
          This is not specific to OpenID Federation but equally valid for
          other protocols when HTTPS to HTTP reverse proxies are used.

            Entity Statements are designed to establish trust relationships between organizational entities within a federation, rather than between individuals or for specific business applications. Trust and reputation assessments for individuals or legal entities, such as those required for Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering processes, should be managed through specialized platforms tailored for those purposes. Given that Entity Statements facilitate trust relationships using a public infrastructure, they should be limited to the essential information necessary for federation operations and organizational trust establishment.

	<t>
	    The Trust Mark Status endpoint enables querying the status
	    of Trust Marks in real time.
	    Similar to the Fetch endpoint,
	    in cases where the Trust Mark Status endpoint is not protected
	    by any client authentication method,
	    requests to validate Trust Marks may not necessarily indicate
	    an actual interaction or relationship between Entities, as they could
	    simply be part of routine network inspection or discovery processes.
	    This could potentially enable Trust Mark issuers to track Entities
	    evaluating Trust Marks about other Entities
	    through standard network diagnostic tools like
	    IPv4/IPv6 addresses and DNS Whois entries.
	    To mitigate tracking risks, implementations can use short-lived Trust Marks,
	    or use the Trust Marked Entities Listing (<xref target="tm_listing"/>)
	    with only the <spanx style="verb">trust_mark_type</spanx> parameter
	    and not the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> parameter,

      <section title="Fetch Endpoint Privacy Considerations"
	       anchor="Fetch-privacy">
	<t>
	  The Fetch endpoint enables querying Subordinate Statements in real time.
	  Similar to Trust Mark Status validation, in the cases where the federation infrastructure is public and widely browsable and endpoints are not protected by any client authentication method, requests to fetch Subordinate Statements may not necessarily indicate an actual interaction or relationship between Entities, as they could simply be part of routine network inspection or discovery processes.
	  However, this could potentially enable Trust Anchors or Intermediates to track Entities evaluating trust relationships with other Entities through standard network diagnostic tools like IPv4/IPv6 addresses and DNS Whois entries.
	  To mitigate tracking risks around Entities inspecting and interacting with other Entities, implementers should consider using static and short-lived Trust Chains where appropriate, which can reduce the need for real-time fetching of Subordinate Statements.

      <t>
        Let us assume the following: The project LIGO would like to offer access
        to its wiki to all OPs in eduGAIN. LIGO is registered with the InCommon
        federation.
      </t>

      <figure>
        <preamble>
	  The following depicts a federation under the eduGAIN Trust Anchor:
        </preamble>
	<name>
          Participants in the eduGAIN Federation
	</name>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
                       eduGAIN
                          |
       +------------------+------------------+
       |                                     |
    SWAMID                               InCommon
       |                                     |
     umu.se                                  |
       |                                     |
   op.umu.se                           wiki.ligo.org
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
        Both SWAMID and InCommon are identity federations in their own right.
        They also have in common that they are both members of
        the eduGAIN federation.
      </t>
      <t>
        SWAMID and InCommon are different in how they register Entities.
        SWAMID registers organizations and lets the organizations register
        Entities that belong to the organization, while InCommon registers all
        Entities directly and not beneath any organization Entity.
        Hence the differences in depth in the federations.
      </t>
      <t>
        Let us assume a researcher from Umeå University would like to
        login to
        the LIGO Wiki. At the Wiki, the researcher will use some kind of
        discovery service to find the home identity provider (op.umu.se).
      </t>
      <t>
        Once the RP part of the Wiki knows which OP it SHOULD talk to, it has
        to find out a few things about the OP. All those things
        can be found in the metadata. But finding the metadata is not enough;
        the RP also has to trust the metadata.
      </t>
      <t>
        Let us make a detour and start with what it takes to build a federation.
      </t>

      <section title="Setting Up a Federation" anchor="federation_intro">
        <t>
          These are the steps to set up a federation infrastructure:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Generation of Trust Anchor signing keys. These MUST be public/private key pairs.
            </t>
            <t>
              Set up a signing service that can sign JWTs/Entity Statements
              using the Federation Entity Keys.
            </t>
            <t>
              Set up web services that can publish signed Entity Statements,
              one for the URL corresponding to the federation's Entity Identifier returning
              an Entity Configuration and the other one providing the fetch endpoint,
	      as described in <xref target="fetch_statement"/>.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Once these requirements have been satisfied, a Federation Operator
          can add Entities to the federation.
          Adding an Entity comes down to:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Providing the Entity with the
              federation's Entity Identifier and the public part of the key pairs used
              by the federation operator for signing Entity Statements.
            </t>
            <t>
              Getting the Entity's Entity Identifier and the JWK Set that the Entity
              plans to publish in its Entity Configuration.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Before the federation operator starts adding Entities, there must
          be policies on who can be part of the federation and the
          layout of the federation. Is it supposed to be a one-layer federation
          like InCommon, a two-layer one like the SWAMID federation,
          or a multi-layer federation?
          The federation may also want to consider implementing other
          policies using the federation policy framework,
          as described in <xref target="federation_policy"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          With the federation in place, things can start happening.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="The LIGO Wiki Discovers the OP's Metadata"
               anchor="op_discovery">
        <t>
          Federation Entity Discovery is a sequence of steps that starts with the RP
          fetching the Entity Configuration of the OP's Entity (in this case,
          https://op.umu.se) using the process defined in
          <xref target="federation_configuration"/>.
          What follows that is this sequence of steps:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
	      Pick out the Immediate Superior Entities using the authority hints.
            </t>
            <t>
              Fetch the Entity Configuration for each such Entity. This uses the
              process defined in
              <xref target="federation_configuration"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
              Use the fetch endpoint of each Immediate Superior to
              obtain Subordinate Statements about the Immediate Subordinate Entity,
              per <xref target="fetch_statement"/>.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          How many times this has to be repeated depends on the depth of the
          federation. What follows below is the result of each step the RP
          has to take to find the OP's metadata using the federation setup
          described above.
        </t>
        <t>
          When building the Trust Chain, the Subordinate Statements issued
          by each Immediate Superior about their Immediate Subordinates are used together with the
          Entity Configuration of the Trust Chain subject.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Entity Configurations of Intermediates are not
          part of the Trust Chain.
        </t>

          <t>The LIGO WIKI RP fetches the Entity Configuration from the

          </t>
          <t>
            The OP successfully resolves the same RP metadata described in
            <xref target="rp_metadata_eval"/>. It then registers the RP in
            compliance with its own OP metadata and returns the result in a
            registration Entity Statement.

          <t>
            Assuming the OP does not support refresh tokens it will register
            the RP for the <spanx style="verb">authorization_code</spanx> grant
            type only. This is reflected in the metadata returned to the RP.
